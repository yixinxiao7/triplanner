**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint #28 — T-229 API Contract Ready)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Re:** T-229 — Trip date COALESCE fix — API contract published, no frontend changes required
**Status:** 📋 Contract published — awaiting implementation (code fix in next phase)

**Summary:**
Sprint 28's T-229 is a pure backend bug fix. No new endpoints, no request/response shape changes, no frontend code changes are needed. This handoff is informational — once T-229 is implemented, the existing "Set dates" UI on TripDetailsPage will begin working correctly.

**What's changing (backend-side only):**
- `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with `start_date`/`end_date` will now correctly return the user-provided values in the response. Previously, trips with no sub-resources always returned `"start_date": null, "end_date": null` even after a successful PATCH.
- All trip-returning endpoints (`GET /api/v1/trips`, `POST /api/v1/trips`, `GET /api/v1/trips/:id`, `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id`) now use COALESCE: user-stored dates take precedence over computed sub-resource aggregates.

**Response shape:** Unchanged. Same `{ "data": { ... "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" ... } }` envelope.

**Frontend action required:** None. The existing `TripDetailsPage` "Set dates" form already calls `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with the correct payload — it will work correctly once T-229 is deployed to staging.

**Full contract details:** See `.workflow/api-contracts.md` → "Sprint 28 Contracts → T-229" section.

**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #28 — T-229 API Contract Ready for Testing Reference)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Re:** T-229 — Trip date COALESCE fix — contract published; QA scope defined
**Task:** T-231 (QA Integration Check) ← Blocked by T-229 implementation
**Status:** 📋 Contract published — QA unblocked to prepare test plan; execution blocked on T-229 completion

**Contract location:** `.workflow/api-contracts.md` → "Sprint 28 Contracts → T-229" section

**What QA must verify for T-229:**

1. **Code review check:**
   - Open `backend/src/models/tripModel.js`
   - Confirm `TRIP_COLUMNS` now wraps both `LEAST(...)` and `GREATEST(...)` in `COALESCE(trips.start_date, ...)` and `COALESCE(trips.end_date, ...)` respectively
   - Confirm `trips.start_date` and `trips.end_date` are referenced (reading the stored column)

2. **New test cases (must all pass in `backend/src/__tests__/trips.test.js`):**
   - Test A: PATCH with `start_date`/`end_date` on trip with NO sub-resources → response returns user values (not null)
   - Test B: PATCH with `start_date`/`end_date` on trip WITH sub-resources (differing computed dates) → response returns user values (not sub-resource aggregates)
   - Test C: Trip with `start_date = null` in DB AND sub-resources → computed aggregate returned (fallback behavior preserved)

3. **Regression check:**
   - Run `npm test --run` in `backend/` — all 363+ tests (including new T-229 tests) must pass
   - Run `npm test --run` in `frontend/` — all 486 tests must pass

4. **Security checklist (T-229 specific):**
   - No new endpoints introduced — attack surface unchanged
   - No schema changes — no migration risk
   - No hardcoded secrets — COALESCE is pure SQL with no user input interpolation
   - No SQL injection surface — TRIP_COLUMNS is a static constant, not user-influenced

5. **Integration smoke test (after staging re-deploy T-232):**
   - `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with `{"start_date":"2026-09-01","end_date":"2026-09-30"}` on a trip with no sub-resources → response must show `"start_date": "2026-09-01"`, `"end_date": "2026-09-30"`
   - `GET /api/v1/trips/:id` for same trip → same dates returned

**No schema changes to verify** — no migration was needed or created for T-229. No handoff to Deploy Engineer for migration.

**Log results** in `.workflow/qa-build-log.md` Sprint 28 section.

**[2026-03-11] Design Agent → All Agents** *(Sprint #28 — T-230 Complete — ui-spec.md TripCalendar section updated)*

**From:** Design Agent
**To:** Frontend Engineer, Manager Agent
**Re:** T-230 — `ui-spec.md` TripCalendar spec accuracy fix (FB-122)
**Status:** ✅ Done — Spec auto-approved (automated sprint)

**Change made:**
Updated `ui-spec.md` **Section 7.2.1 (Part B — Calendar Component, Overview)** to remove the inaccurate statement "It uses data already fetched by the `useTripDetails` hook — no additional API calls."

The section now documents the **self-contained fetch pattern** that matches the actual implementation:
- `TripCalendar.jsx` receives only a `tripId` prop.
- On mount (and on `tripId` change), it fires its own `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` request.
- The `/calendar` endpoint returns pre-shaped event data (`start_date`, `end_date`, `start_time`, `end_time` per event), which is why a dedicated fetch is preferred over reshaping raw `useTripDetails` data client-side.
- The spec now explicitly states: do **not** refactor `TripCalendar` to consume `useTripDetails` data — the self-contained fetch is the canonical pattern.

**No action required from the Frontend Engineer** — this is a documentation correction only; no code changes are needed. The implementation already matches the updated spec.

**[2026-03-11] Manager Agent → All Agents** *(Sprint #28 Kickoff — Sprint #27 Closed)*

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** All Agents
**Re:** Sprint 27 closed — Sprint 28 plan published — T-229 is the immediate P0 task
**Tasks:** T-229 (Backend Engineer), T-230 (Design Agent), T-231 (QA), T-232 (Deploy), T-233 (Monitor), T-234 (User Agent), T-224/T-225 (carry-over)

**Status:** Sprint #28 active. Sprint #27 summary written to sprint-log.md.

---

**Sprint 27 Outcome:**

- ✅ T-228 Done — CORS staging fix (Fix A + Fix B) shipped and verified; 363/363 backend, 486/486 frontend
- ✅ T-219 Done — User Agent walkthrough complete; 10 feedback entries submitted (FB-113–FB-122)
- ⛔ T-224 Blocked — production deployment carry-over (project owner must provision AWS RDS + Render)
- ⛔ T-225 Backlog — blocked on T-224

**Sprint 28 Priorities:**

1. **T-229 (Backend Engineer — P0 — START IMMEDIATELY):** Fix `backend/src/models/tripModel.js` TRIP_COLUMNS SQL to use `COALESCE(trips.start_date, <computed LEAST(...)>)` and `COALESCE(trips.end_date, <computed GREATEST(...)>)`. This makes user-provided trip dates take precedence over sub-resource aggregates. Add 3 new tests. All 363+ existing tests must pass. See FB-113 in feedback-log.md for full details and exact steps to reproduce.

2. **T-230 (Design Agent — P3 — can run in parallel):** Update `ui-spec.md` TripCalendar section — remove "no additional API calls" statement; document the self-contained `GET /calendar` fetch pattern.

3. **T-231 → T-232 → T-233 → T-234 (sequential after T-229):** Standard QA/Deploy/Monitor/User Agent pipeline. T-233 Monitor must add an explicit PATCH trip date smoke test to verify T-229.

4. **T-224/T-225 (Carry-over — blocked on project owner):** No engineering action possible until project owner provisions AWS RDS + Render. Third escalation.

**Staging environment status at Sprint 28 kickoff:**
- Backend: `https://localhost:3001` — pm2 online, 363/363 tests, CORS correct
- Frontend: `https://localhost:4173` — pm2 online, 486/486 tests, 4/4 Playwright PASS
- All 10 migrations applied — schema-stable (T-229 is query-only, no new migration)

**[2026-03-11] Manager Agent → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #27 — T-228 APPROVED → Integration Check)*

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** QA Engineer
**Re:** T-228 code review passed — ready for integration check and security checklist
**Task:** T-228 (CORS staging fix)

**Status:** ✅ Code Review APPROVED — T-228 is now in **Integration Check**

---

**What was reviewed:**

T-228 fixes a P0 CORS staging bug caused by ESM `import` hoisting in `backend/src/index.js`. Two fixes were implemented:

- **Fix A (Deploy Engineer):** `CORS_ORIGIN: 'https://localhost:4173'` added to `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` `triplanner-backend` env block. pm2 injects this before the Node process starts, ensuring the value is present when app.js evaluates the cors middleware.
- **Fix B (Backend Engineer):** `backend/src/index.js` now calls `dotenv.config()` first, then loads `app.js` via dynamic `await import('./app.js')`. This eliminates the hoisting race condition at the language level.

**Test coverage:** 8 new tests in `backend/src/__tests__/cors.test.js` — happy paths (correct origin allowed, credentials header, staging origin, fallback) + error paths (disallowed origin rejected, staging blocked without env var). Backend test count: 363/363.

**Action required from QA Engineer:**

Please run the **Integration Check and Security Checklist** for T-228:
1. Run `npm test --run` in `backend/` — all 363 tests must pass
2. Verify `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` contains `CORS_ORIGIN: 'https://localhost:4173'` in the triplanner-backend env block
3. Verify `backend/src/index.js` uses dynamic `await import('./app.js')` (not static import)
4. Security checklist: no hardcoded secrets, no SQL injection surface, no XSS surface, auth middleware unchanged
5. CORS regression check: confirm `app.js` still has `credentials: true` and `helmet()` middleware
6. Log results in `qa-build-log.md` Sprint 27 section
7. If all checks pass: move T-228 to **Done**

**Files changed:**
- `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` (Fix A)
- `backend/src/index.js` (Fix B)
- `backend/src/__tests__/cors.test.js` (8 new tests)

**[2026-03-11] Deploy Engineer → User Agent** *(Sprint #27 — T-228 Fix A Complete: CORS Staging Bug Fixed — T-219 UNBLOCKED)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** User Agent
**Re:** T-228 Fix A deployed — staging CORS fixed — T-219 walkthrough is now unblocked
**Task:** T-228 (Fix A), T-219 (now unblocked)

**Status:** ✅ Fix A Live — User Agent browser testing is UNBLOCKED

---

**What was fixed:**

The staging backend was returning `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173` (the wrong fallback origin) instead of `https://localhost:4173`. This CORS mismatch caused all browser-initiated API calls from the staging frontend to be blocked by the browser.

**Root cause:** ESM static import hoisting in `backend/src/index.js` caused `app.js` to capture `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN` as `undefined` before `dotenv.config()` ran.

**Fix applied:** Added `CORS_ORIGIN: 'https://localhost:4173'` to the `triplanner-backend` env block in `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs`. pm2 injects this env var before the Node.js process starts, so the value is correctly captured at module initialization.

**Verification:**

```
curl -sk -I https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health -H "Origin: https://localhost:4173"
→ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173  ✅
→ Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true  ✅
→ HTTP/1.1 200 OK  ✅

OPTIONS preflight:
→ 204 No Content  ✅
→ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173  ✅
→ Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE  ✅
```

**Staging environment status:**
- `triplanner-backend`: online (pid 70180)
- `triplanner-frontend`: online (pid 64982)
- Staging frontend: `https://localhost:4173`
- Staging backend: `https://localhost:3001`
- Login credentials: `test@triplanner.local` / `TestPass123!`

**Action required from User Agent:**

Please proceed with **T-219** — the Sprint 25/26 feature walkthrough:

1. **TripCalendar** (primary verification):
   - TripDetailsPage shows live TripCalendar component (not placeholder)
   - Flights, stays, and activities render on calendar grid with correct dates
   - FLIGHT / STAY / ACTIVITY color-coded pills are visually distinct
   - Clicking an event scrolls to the corresponding section
   - Trip with no sub-resources shows empty state message

2. **Regression suite:**
   - StatusFilterTabs: All / Planning / Ongoing / Completed filter correctly; 0 matches → empty state + "Show all" reset
   - TripStatusSelector: badge shows status; click → update; keyboard nav (Space/Enter/Arrows/Escape); Home page reflects change
   - Trip notes: empty → edit → char count → save → displays; clear → placeholder returns
   - Destination validation: 101-char destination → 400 human-friendly error
   - Rate limiting: login lockout after 10 attempts
   - Print button visible on TripDetailsPage
   - start_date/end_date visible on trip cards

3. Submit structured feedback to `feedback-log.md` under **"Sprint 27 User Agent Feedback"** with Category, Severity, and Status: New for each entry.

Full Fix A details: `.workflow/qa-build-log.md` → Sprint #27 section.

**[2026-03-11] Deploy Engineer → Monitor Agent** *(Sprint #27 — T-228 Fix A Complete: CORS Fixed — Post-Restart Health Check Requested)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** Monitor Agent
**Re:** T-228 Fix A deployed — CORS_ORIGIN injected via pm2 — backend restarted — post-restart health check requested
**Task:** T-228 Fix A

**Status:** ✅ Fix A Live — Health check requested for Monitor Agent validation

---

**Deploy action taken:**

- `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs`: added `CORS_ORIGIN: 'https://localhost:4173'` to `triplanner-backend` env block
- pm2: `delete triplanner-backend` → `pm2 start infra/ecosystem.config.cjs --only triplanner-backend` (fresh start from updated config)
- Deploy Engineer self-verification: 7/7 checks PASS (see `qa-build-log.md` Sprint #27 section)

**Monitor Agent verification requested:**

Please run your standard staging health check and confirm:
1. `GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health` → `200 {"status":"ok"}`
2. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173` header present on response
3. `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header present
4. OPTIONS preflight → `204 No Content` with correct CORS headers
5. Login flow: `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with `test@triplanner.local` / `TestPass123!` → `200 OK`

Note: **T-224** (production deployment) remains blocked pending project owner providing AWS RDS + Render account access. Escalation in progress.

**[2026-03-11] Frontend Engineer → (No QA Handoff Required)** *(Sprint #27 — No Frontend Tasks Assigned)*

**From:** Frontend Engineer
**To:** N/A — no QA handoff required (no frontend implementation this sprint)
**Status:** ✅ API contract acknowledged — no frontend tasks assigned in Sprint #27

**API Contract Acknowledgment:**

Reviewed Sprint #27 API contracts in `.workflow/api-contracts.md`. Confirmed:
- **Zero new endpoints.** All existing API contracts from Sprints 1–26 remain in force, unchanged.
- **Zero schema changes.** T-228 (Fix B) is a pure internal dotenv/ESM hoisting refactor with no observable API contract impact for the frontend.
- **No new frontend integration work required.** The CORS fix means browser-initiated API calls (which were previously failing due to wrong `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header) will now succeed — this unblocks User Agent testing but requires no frontend code changes.

**Frontend test baseline verified:** 486/486 tests pass (25 test files). No regressions from Sprint 26.

**Sprint #27 Frontend Engineer work:** None assigned. All Sprint 27 tasks belong to Backend Engineer (T-228 Fix B), Deploy Engineer (T-228 Fix A, T-224), User Agent (T-219), and Monitor Agent (T-225).

---

**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint #27 — API Contracts Published)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Re:** Sprint #27 API contracts — no new endpoints; no frontend integration work required
**Task:** T-228 (Fix B — Backend Engineer scope)

**Status:** ✅ Contracts Published — No Frontend Action Required

**Summary:**

Sprint #27 introduces **zero new API endpoints and zero schema changes**. The Backend Engineer's sole task (T-228 Fix B) is a pure internal code refactor that fixes ESM dotenv hoisting in `backend/src/index.js` so that `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN` is correctly populated before the CORS middleware captures it.

**What this means for Frontend:**
- All existing API contracts from Sprints 1–26 remain in force, unchanged
- No new integration work is required this sprint
- The observable effect of T-228 is that staging will start returning the correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173` header, which **unblocks** browser-based API calls — this is a fix, not a contract change
- The calendar endpoint (`GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar`) and all other endpoints are unaffected

**Sprint #27 API contract section:** `.workflow/api-contracts.md` → "Sprint 27 — API Contracts"

No acknowledgement required; no new integration needed. Frontend should proceed with User Agent testing unblocked once T-228 Fix A (Deploy Engineer: pm2 env var) is confirmed live on staging.

**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #27 — API Contracts Published for QA Reference)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Re:** Sprint #27 API contracts — no new endpoints; QA scope limited to CORS regression test
**Task:** T-228 (Fix B — Backend Engineer scope)

**Status:** ✅ Contracts Published — QA Reference Ready

**Summary:**

Sprint #27 introduces **zero new API endpoints and zero schema changes**. All existing contracts from Sprints 1–26 remain valid and unchanged. The sole Backend Engineer task (T-228 Fix B) is a code refactor fixing ESM dotenv hoisting.

**QA Testing Scope for T-228:**

A **new CORS regression test** must be added (or verified as added by the Backend Engineer as part of Fix B). The test lives at `backend/src/__tests__/cors.test.js` (new file, or added to an existing integration suite):

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN` is set (e.g., `https://localhost:4173`) | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173` is returned |
| `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN` is unset | Fallback `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173` is returned |
| OPTIONS preflight from staging origin | Response includes `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` |
| Request from disallowed origin | No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header returned (or CORS error) |

**Test baseline to maintain:** 355/355 backend tests must continue passing after the refactor.

**Integration verification (post-Fix-A + Fix-B):**
- `curl -sk -I https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health -H "Origin: https://localhost:4173"` → must include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173`
- `curl -sk -I https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health -H "Origin: https://localhost:4173"` → must include `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
- Browser-initiated login flow from `https://localhost:4173` → must succeed without CORS error in browser console

**No schema changes. No migration action required. No new endpoints to test.**

**[2026-03-11] Design Agent → Manager Agent** *(Sprint #27 — Design Agent Assessment)*

**From:** Design Agent
**To:** Manager Agent
**Re:** Sprint #27 — No Design Agent tasks in scope; UI specs up to date; no action required

**Status:** ✅ Complete — No new specs needed this sprint

---

**Assessment Summary:**

After reviewing `active-sprint.md`, `dev-cycle-tracker.md` (Sprint 27 tasks), `project-brief.md`, and `feedback-log.md`, the Design Agent confirms:

**Sprint #27 has no frontend feature work and no Design Agent task assignments.**

The sprint is scoped entirely to:
1. **T-228** — CORS staging bug fix (Backend Engineer + Deploy Engineer infrastructure work; no UI changes)
2. **T-219** — User Agent walkthrough of existing features (testing only; no new UI to design)
3. **T-224** — Production deployment to Render + AWS RDS (infrastructure; no UI changes)
4. **T-225** — Post-production health check (monitoring only; no UI changes)

The active sprint explicitly states: *"No new feature work this sprint. Stabilize and ship production first."*

**Feedback Log Review (for UX issues):**

No UX issues were logged in `feedback-log.md` that require Design Agent attention this sprint. The two Monitor Alerts (CORS mismatch, Playwright rate limiter) are infrastructure concerns already tasked to engineering. No user-facing UX bugs or feature gap entries are tagged for Design Agent follow-up.

**UI Spec Status:**

All existing specs in `ui-spec.md` remain valid and up to date. No spec amendments are needed based on the Sprint 26→27 feedback triage.

**Design Agent will resume active spec work when Sprint #28 introduces new frontend features.**

| T-224 (Deploy: Production deploy) | ⛔ Blocked — project owner must provide AWS + Render access |
| T-225 (Monitor: Post-production health check) | ⏭ Blocked on T-224 |

**Sprint #27 Priorities:**

**P0 — Backend Engineer + Deploy Engineer: T-228 — CORS staging fix (START IMMEDIATELY)**

The Monitor Agent's Sprint 26 post-deploy health check found a Major bug:
- Staging backend serves `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173` instead of `https://localhost:4173`
- Root cause: ESM import hoisting in `backend/src/index.js` — `app.js` is imported before `dotenv.config()` runs, so `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN` is `undefined` when CORS middleware captures it
- Impact: All browser-initiated API calls from staging frontend (`https://localhost:4173`) are CORS-blocked; login, trip creation, all authenticated flows fail in browser

**Fix A (Deploy Engineer — immediate, no code change):**
1. Add `CORS_ORIGIN: 'https://localhost:4173'` to the `triplanner-backend` env block in `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs`
2. `pm2 restart triplanner-backend`
3. Verify: `curl -sk -I https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health -H "Origin: https://localhost:4173"` → `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173`

**Fix B (Backend Engineer — permanent code fix):**
1. Refactor `backend/src/index.js` to ensure dotenv loads before `app.js` executes
   - Option: Use dynamic `import()` for `app.js` so dotenv runs synchronously first
   - Option: Move `dotenv.config()` to the first line of `app.js` before any middleware
2. Re-run `npm test --run` in `backend/` — confirm all 355+ tests still pass
3. Add/update integration test asserting CORS origin is correctly read from `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN`
4. Log results in `qa-build-log.md` Sprint 27 section
5. Log handoff to User Agent (T-219) in handoff-log.md once Fix A is confirmed working

Both fixes must be implemented. Fix A unblocks User Agent testing immediately; Fix B prevents recurrence.

---

**P0 — User Agent: T-219 — Feature walkthrough (after T-228 Fix A confirmed)**

This is the 4th consecutive carry-over of the User Agent walkthrough. It **must** complete this sprint.

Scope:
1. TripCalendar component (Sprint 25 feature — primary verification)
2. Full regression suite (StatusFilterTabs, TripStatusSelector, trip notes, destination validation, rate limiting, print button, date range on cards)

Submit structured feedback to `feedback-log.md` under **"Sprint 27 User Agent Feedback"** with Category, Severity, and Status: New for each entry.

---

**P1 — Deploy Engineer: T-224 — Production deployment (PROJECT OWNER GATE)**

⚠️ **Escalation to project owner:** Production deployment has been deferred for 26 sprints. All engineering is complete:
- `render.yaml` Blueprint: ready (`/render.yaml`)
- Production deploy guide: ready (`docs/production-deploy-guide.md`)
- Backend config (SSL, SameSite): ready (T-220, T-221)
- QA-verified: 355/355 tests pass, 0 vulnerabilities

**What the project owner must provide:**
1. AWS account access to create an RDS PostgreSQL 15 instance (db.t3.micro, us-east-1, free tier, ~$0/month within free tier)
2. Render account — connect the GitHub repo, apply the render.yaml Blueprint (or create services manually per the deploy guide)

Once access is provided, Deploy Engineer can execute T-224 immediately. All steps are documented in `docs/production-deploy-guide.md`.

---

**P1 — Monitor Agent: T-225 — Post-production health check (after T-224)**

8-point production health check. Blockers: T-224 must complete first. Instructions in active-sprint.md.

**Token acquisition reminder:** Use `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with `test@triplanner.local` / `TestPass123!` (seeded via T-226) — do NOT use `POST /auth/register` for token acquisition. This was the root cause of Sprint 22 and Sprint 25 Playwright failures.

1. `GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health` → expect `{"status":"ok"}`
2. Frontend loads at `https://localhost:4173` (self-signed cert — use `-k` flag with curl)
3. Auth flow: `POST https://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login` with `test@triplanner.local` / `TestPass123!` (use seed script first if not already seeded: `cd backend && npm run seed`)
4. Protected endpoint: `GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/trips` with Bearer token → expect 200
5. Calendar endpoint: `GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` with Bearer token → expect 200 or 404 (no trips is ok)
6. Rate limiter: confirm login succeeds (not exhausted after restart)

**Note on T-224 (Production Deploy):** T-224 is ⛔ Blocked — project owner must provision AWS RDS + Render. This staging check covers the Sprint 26 code changes. The separate T-225 (production health check) remains Backlog pending T-224 completion.

**[2026-03-11] Manager Agent → (No QA Handoff Required)** *(Sprint #26 — CR-26: Code Review Pass Complete — All Prior Approvals Confirmed)*

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** No new handoffs required — QA (T-223) is already Done; pipeline is at gate on project owner action
**Status:** Code review pass complete — no tasks in "In Review"

**Summary:**

Sprint #26 code review pass #2 completed. No tasks were in "In Review" status at time of invocation. All prior Manager approvals for Sprint 26 were validated via on-disk code spot-check:

- **T-220** ✅ — `backend/src/config/knexfile.js` production block confirmed correct: `ssl.rejectUnauthorized=false`, `pool: {min:1, max:5}`, `connectionString` from env. Dev/staging unchanged. 5 unit tests on disk.
- **T-221** ✅ — `backend/src/routes/auth.js` cookie helpers confirmed correct: `getSameSite()` gates on `NODE_ENV=production`; `isSecureCookie()` gates correctly; both set/clear cookie functions use both helpers; `httpOnly` preserved. 3 integration tests on disk.
- **T-222** ✅ — `render.yaml` confirmed: no hardcoded secrets, both services Ohio/free, `startCommand: node src/index.js` matches actual entry point, SPA rewrite rule present. `docs/production-deploy-guide.md` confirmed complete (all 6 steps including migration and SameSite=None verification).
- **T-226** ✅ — `backend/src/seeds/test_user.js` confirmed: idempotent `onConflict/ignore`, bcrypt 12 rounds, minimal fields. `.agents/monitor-agent.md` updated with login-not-register protocol. 7 unit tests on disk.

**Sprint 26 pipeline status at code review completion:**
- T-218: ✅ Done — Playwright 4/4 PASS
- T-219: Backlog — **User Agent must proceed immediately** (T-218 unblocked; Deploy Engineer handoff logged)
- T-220: ✅ Done
- T-221: ✅ Done
- T-222: ✅ Done
- T-223: ✅ Done (QA pre-production review passed; 355/355 backend, 486/486 frontend, 0 vuln)
- T-224: ⛔ **Blocked — project owner action required** (AWS RDS + Render account provisioning)
- T-225: Backlog (blocked on T-224)
- T-226: ✅ Done

**No further Manager action required this phase.** Next Manager invocation should handle: T-219 feedback triage (after User Agent submits feedback) and T-225 monitor results triage.

**[2026-03-11] Deploy Engineer → Manager Agent** *(Sprint #26 — T-218 ✅ 4/4 PASS + T-222 ✅ Done + T-224 ⛔ BLOCKED: Requires Project Owner Action)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** Manager Agent
**Status:** T-218 Done, T-222 Done, T-224 Blocked — Project owner must provision AWS + Render

**T-218 — Playwright 4/4 PASS ✅**

Backend restart + Playwright rerun (second attempt):
- `pm2 restart triplanner-backend` → PID 63803 online ✅
- Rate limiter cleared ✅
- `npx playwright test` → **4/4 PASS** (11.1s total)
  - Test 1: Core user flow ✅ (1.3s)
  - Test 2: Sub-resource CRUD ✅ (1.2s)
  - Test 3: Search, filter, sort ✅ (3.7s)
  - Test 4: Rate limit lockout ✅ (3.9s)
- Health check `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health` → `{"status":"ok"}` ✅

T-216 Playwright carry-over fully resolved. **T-219 (User Agent walkthrough) is now unblocked.**

**T-222 — render.yaml + Deploy Guide ✅ Done**

Status corrected Backlog → Done. Files already present and QA-verified (T-223):
- `render.yaml` at project root — two services, no hardcoded secrets, ohio region, free plan
- `docs/production-deploy-guide.md` — complete with RDS setup, env vars, migration step, post-deploy checklist

**T-224 — Production Deploy ⛔ BLOCKED — Needs Project Owner**

Pre-deploy gate: T-223 QA PASSED ✅. All application code is production-ready. Deployment cannot proceed because neither AWS CLI nor Render CLI is available in the agent environment.

**Project owner must complete the following steps from `docs/production-deploy-guide.md`:**

1. **AWS RDS** (Step 1): Create PostgreSQL 15, `db.t3.micro`, `us-east-1`, free tier, public access on, port 5432 open to `0.0.0.0/0`
2. **Render Blueprint** (Steps 2–3): New → Blueprint → connect `triplanner` repo → `render.yaml` detected → Apply → set `sync: false` env vars:
   - `triplanner-backend`: `DATABASE_URL` (from RDS), `CORS_ORIGIN=https://triplanner-frontend.onrender.com`
   - `triplanner-frontend`: `VITE_API_URL=https://triplanner-backend.onrender.com/api/v1`
3. **Migrations** (Step 4): `export DATABASE_URL="<rds-url>" && export NODE_ENV=production && cd backend && npx knex migrate:latest --knexfile src/config/knexfile.js`
4. **Deploy + Smoke tests** (Steps 5–6): Trigger Render deploy; run 7-point checklist including SameSite=None cookie verification

Once production URLs are confirmed, log them in handoff-log.md so Monitor Agent can run T-225.

**[2026-03-11] Frontend Engineer → (No Handoff Required)** *(Sprint #26 — API Contract Acknowledgment: T-220, T-221, T-226)*

**From:** Frontend Engineer
**To:** N/A — no QA handoff required (no frontend implementation this sprint)
**Status:** Contract acknowledged — no frontend tasks assigned in Sprint #26

**API Contract Acknowledgment:**

Per the Backend Engineer's Sprint #26 contract notification (logged 2026-03-11), I have read and acknowledged the following:

- **No new API endpoints in Sprint #26.** The API surface is identical to Sprint #25.
- **T-221 — Cookie SameSite=None (production):** `refresh_token` cookie will use `SameSite=None; Secure` in production (`NODE_ENV=production`). This is a server-set header — no frontend code changes are required. The existing auth token flow (in-memory access token, automatic refresh via axios interceptor) is unaffected.
- **T-220 (knexfile SSL) and T-226 (seed script):** Zero frontend impact — internal backend infrastructure only.

**Sprint #26 Frontend Engineer scope:** None. No tasks are assigned to the Frontend Engineer in Sprint #26 (confirmed via `active-sprint.md` Agent Assignments table and `dev-cycle-tracker.md` Sprint 26 task board). No frontend files were modified this sprint.

**Codebase status:** Frontend remains at **486/486 tests passing** (confirmed by QA T-223 entry above). No regressions introduced.

**[2026-03-11] QA Engineer → Deploy Engineer** *(Sprint #26 — T-223 COMPLETE: Pre-Production Gate PASSED → T-224 Unblocked)*

**From:** QA Engineer
**To:** Deploy Engineer
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Production Deployment (T-224)

**Summary:** T-223 pre-production security + configuration review is complete. All gates passed. T-224 (production deployment) is unblocked.

**Verified Items:**

**T-220 — knexfile.js Production SSL + Pool Config** ✅
- `backend/src/config/knexfile.js` production block confirmed: `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`, `pool: { min: 1, max: 5 }`, `connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL`
- Dev and staging configs unchanged — no ssl block

**T-221 — Cookie SameSite=None in Production** ✅
- `getSameSite()` returns `'none'` when `NODE_ENV=production`, `'strict'` otherwise
- `isSecureCookie()` returns `true` in production
- Both `setRefreshCookie()` and `clearRefreshCookie()` use both helpers
- `httpOnly: true` preserved

**T-222 — render.yaml + Production Deploy Guide** ✅
- No hardcoded secrets: `DATABASE_URL` (`sync: false`), `JWT_SECRET` (`generateValue: true`), `CORS_ORIGIN` (`sync: false`), `VITE_API_URL` (`sync: false`)
- `NODE_ENV=production` set for backend service
- Both services in Ohio region, free plan
- `docs/production-deploy-guide.md` complete: RDS setup, env vars, migration step (Step 4), post-deploy checklist with SameSite=None verification, rollback procedure

**T-226 — test_user Seed Script** ✅
- `backend/src/seeds/test_user.js`: idempotent via `onConflict('email').ignore()`, bcrypt 12 rounds, minimal fields only

**Test Results:**
- Backend: **355/355 PASS** (340 baseline + 15 new Sprint 26 tests)
- Frontend: **486/486 PASS**
- npm audit: **0 vulnerabilities**

**Config Consistency:** No mismatches — backend PORT=3000 matches vite proxy default, CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173 matches frontend dev server, SSL not enabled in dev (consistent)

**Security Checklist:** All applicable items verified — Helmet headers, rate limiting, bcrypt hashing, parameterized queries, error handler (no stack trace leakage), CORS via env var, JWT_SECRET from env. No P1 security issues.

**Action required for T-224 (Deploy Engineer):**
Follow `docs/production-deploy-guide.md` in order:
1. Create AWS RDS PostgreSQL 15 instance (db.t3.micro, us-east-1)
2. Set up Render services via `render.yaml` Blueprint
3. Configure all environment variables (DATABASE_URL, CORS_ORIGIN, VITE_API_URL)
4. Run database migrations: `knex migrate:latest` (10 migrations, 001–010)
5. Trigger Render deploy
6. Run post-deploy smoke tests (7 checks in Step 6 of deploy guide, including SameSite=None cookie verification)
7. Log production URLs in handoff-log.md; handoff to Monitor Agent (T-225)

**Note on T-218 Playwright regression:** Playwright remains at 2/4 due to pre-existing test spec issues (not application bugs). This is NOT a blocker for T-224. Application code is correct — the production deployment can proceed.

**[2026-03-11] Manager Agent → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #26 — Code Review PASSED: T-220, T-221, T-226 → Integration Check)*

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** Handoff — All three Sprint 26 backend tasks passed code review. Ready for Integration Check.

**Tasks Approved:**

**T-220 — knexfile.js production SSL + pool config** ✅
- `backend/src/config/knexfile.js` production block: `connection.ssl.rejectUnauthorized=false`, `pool: {min:1, max:5}`, `connectionString` from `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.
- No hardcoded secrets. Dev/staging blocks unchanged.
- 5 unit tests in `sprint26.test.js` all passing assertions verified on inspection.
- Status → **Integration Check**

**T-221 — Cookie SameSite=None in production** ✅
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js`: `getSameSite()` returns `'none'` when `NODE_ENV=production`, `'strict'` otherwise. `isSecureCookie()` gates on `COOKIE_SECURE` or `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Both `setRefreshCookie()` and `clearRefreshCookie()` use both helpers — correct for cross-origin cookie clearing.
- `httpOnly: true` preserved. No secret leakage.
- 3 integration tests cover non-production Strict path and production None+Secure path.
- Status → **Integration Check**

**T-226 — Monitor Agent health check process fix** ✅
- `backend/src/seeds/test_user.js`: idempotent via `onConflict('email').ignore()`, bcrypt 12 rounds, minimal fields.
- `.agents/monitor-agent.md`: Token Acquisition section added — login-not-register protocol with credentials, example request, and rationale clearly documented.
- 7 unit tests covering email, name, bcrypt hash validity, onConflict, ignore, idempotency, and minimal fields.
- Status → **Integration Check**

**QA action required:**
1. Run `npm test --run` in `backend/` — confirm Sprint 26 tests pass and total count holds at 340+.
2. Run `npm audit` in `backend/` — confirm 0 vulnerabilities.
3. Verify T-220: production knex config has ssl.rejectUnauthorized=false and pool.max=5.
4. Verify T-221: production cookie config has sameSite='none' and secure=true; staging/dev unchanged.
5. Verify T-222 (render.yaml from Deploy Engineer handoff): no hardcoded secrets, all sensitive values as env var references.
6. Full report in `qa-build-log.md` Sprint 26 section. Then log handoff to Deploy Engineer (T-224).

**Note:** T-222 (render.yaml) is already Done per Deploy Engineer handoff — T-223 blocker on T-220+T-221 is now cleared. QA (T-223) can begin immediately.

**[2026-03-11] Deploy Engineer → Manager Agent** *(Sprint #26 — T-218: Playwright Still 2/4 — Blocker Requires Frontend/QA Fix)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** Manager Agent
**Status:** Blocker — Playwright 4/4 gate not achieved; test spec regressions from Sprint 25

**Summary of T-218:**

Backend `triplanner-backend` was restarted via `pm2 restart triplanner-backend`. Rate limiter state was cleared (confirmed by Test 4 passing). However Playwright 2/4 PASS — not the expected 4/4.

**Two test spec bugs discovered:**

**Bug 1 — Wrong aria-label selector (Test 2):**
- The e2e spec at `e2e/critical-flows.spec.js:202` uses `getByText('SFO')` to verify a flight was added.
- Sprint 25 TripCalendar component added event pills to TripDetailsPage. These pills now also render 'SFO' text, creating 3 DOM elements matching `getByText('SFO')`. Playwright's strict mode rejects this.
- Fix needed: Use a more specific selector (e.g., `getByTestId`, `page.locator('.airportCode').first()`, or scoped to the flights section).
- **Owner: Frontend Engineer or QA Engineer**

**Bug 2 — Intra-run rate limiter exhaustion (Test 3):**
- Tests 1 and 2 each call `POST /auth/register` to create a new user. By the time Test 3 tries to register a third user, the rate limiter blocks the registration.
- Fix needed: Either (a) use the seeded test user (T-226) for auth in tests instead of registering fresh users per test, or (b) increase rate limit window for staging, or (c) add `rateLimit.resetKey()` between tests in a `beforeEach` hook.
- **Owner: QA Engineer**

**Fix applied (Deploy Engineer scope):**
- Line 88: Changed `dialog.getByLabel('Add destination')` → `dialog.getByLabel('New destination')` (the input's actual aria-label). This fixed Test 1 (now ✅). The button was labeled "Add destination"; the input is "New destination". Comment corrected.

**Current state:** Playwright 2/4 (Tests 1 ✅, 4 ✅ pass; Tests 2, 3 ❌ require test spec updates).

**Action required:** Manager to assign test spec fix to Frontend Engineer or QA Engineer before T-219 (User Agent) runs, to ensure Playwright gate is clear.

**[2026-03-11] Deploy Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #26 — T-222 DONE: render.yaml + Deploy Guide Ready for Review)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** Ready for T-223 pre-production review

**Summary of T-222:**

Two files published:

**1. `render.yaml` (project root)**
- Defines `triplanner-backend` (Node.js web service, Ohio, free) and `triplanner-frontend` (static site, Ohio, free)
- No hardcoded secrets — `DATABASE_URL` is `sync: false`, `JWT_SECRET` is `generateValue: true`, `CORS_ORIGIN` and `VITE_API_URL` are `sync: false`
- `NODE_ENV=production` is set (activates T-221 SameSite=None cookie behavior)
- SPA rewrite rule (`/* → /index.html`) included for React Router

**2. `docs/production-deploy-guide.md`**
- Covers: AWS RDS PostgreSQL 15 setup (db.t3.micro, us-east-1), Render Blueprint deploy, all environment variables for both services, database migration (Option A: local via env var, Option B: Render shell), post-deploy smoke test checklist (7 curl-based checks including SameSite cookie verification), custom domain (optional), rollback procedure.

**QA Review Checklist for T-223:**
- [ ] `render.yaml`: no hardcoded secrets (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, CORS_ORIGIN, VITE_API_URL are all sync:false or generateValue:true)
- [ ] `render.yaml`: NODE_ENV=production present for backend service
- [ ] `render.yaml`: both services in ohio region, free plan
- [ ] `docs/production-deploy-guide.md`: migration step present (Step 4)
- [ ] `docs/production-deploy-guide.md`: env var configuration documented for both services (Step 3)
- [ ] `docs/production-deploy-guide.md`: post-deploy checklist present with SameSite cookie check (Step 6)
- [ ] T-220: `backend/src/config/knexfile.js` production block has `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` and `pool: { max: 5 }` ← **Backend Engineer must complete this before T-223**
- [ ] T-221: `backend/src/routes/auth.js` production cookie has `sameSite: 'none'`, `secure: true` ← **Backend Engineer must complete this before T-223**
- [ ] Backend tests: 340+ passing (`npm test --run` in `backend/`)
- [ ] npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities

**T-220 and T-221 confirmed implemented (In Review):**
- `backend/src/config/knexfile.js` production block: `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`, `pool: { min: 1, max: 5 }` ✅
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` `getSameSite()` returns `'none'` when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`; `isSecureCookie()` returns `true` in production ✅
- T-222's blockers (T-220, T-221) are satisfied — QA can proceed with T-223 full checklist.

**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #26 — Implementation Complete: T-220, T-221, T-226)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** Ready for review — 3 backend tasks implemented, 15 new tests added (355/355 total pass)

**Summary:** Sprint 26 backend implementation complete. Three tasks are now In Review:

**T-220 — knexfile.js Production SSL + Pool Config:**
- File: `backend/src/config/knexfile.js`
- Change: `production` config block now uses `connection: { connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } }` and `pool: { min: 1, max: 5 }`
- Tests: 5 unit tests in `sprint26.test.js` verify `ssl.rejectUnauthorized === false`, `pool.max === 5`, `pool.min === 1`, connection is an object with `connectionString`, and dev/staging are unchanged
- Security: No secrets hardcoded — `DATABASE_URL` read from `process.env` only

**T-221 — Cookie SameSite=None in Production:**
- File: `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
- Change: Added `getSameSite()` helper that returns `'none'` when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, `'strict'` otherwise. Both `setRefreshCookie` and `clearRefreshCookie` use it.
- Tests: 3 integration tests in `sprint26.test.js` — (1) non-production → SameSite=Strict, (2) production → SameSite=None, (3) production → Secure flag present
- Existing `isSecureCookie()` already handles `secure: true` for production — no double-coverage needed

**T-226 — test_user Seed Script:**
- File: `backend/src/seeds/test_user.js`
- Creates test user `test@triplanner.local` / `TestPass123!` (bcrypt 12 rounds) using `onConflict('email').ignore()` — idempotent
- Updated `.agents/monitor-agent.md` — added "Token Acquisition" section documenting login-not-register protocol
- Tests: 6 unit tests in `sprint26.test.js` — correct email/name/hash, onConflict('email') called, ignore() called, idempotent, fields minimal

**What QA should verify (T-223):**
1. `backend/src/config/knexfile.js` production block — `ssl.rejectUnauthorized === false`, `pool.max === 5`, `pool.min === 1`
2. `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — production cookie has `SameSite=None; Secure`; non-production has `SameSite=Strict`
3. `backend/src/seeds/test_user.js` — insert payload has name/email/password_hash only; `onConflict('email').ignore()` called
4. Run `npm test --run` in `backend/` — expect 355/355 pass (340 baseline + 15 new)
5. Run `npm audit` in `backend/` — expect 0 vulnerabilities
6. No hardcoded secrets, no SQL concatenation, error messages safe

**No schema changes this sprint** — migration log stable at 10 migrations (001–010). No `knex migrate:latest` required.

---

**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → Deploy Engineer** *(Sprint #26 — T-220, T-221, T-226 Implementation Notes)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Deploy Engineer
**Status:** Backend tasks In Review — Deploy unblocked for T-222 once QA approves (T-223)

**Summary:**

**T-220 confirmed:** `backend/src/config/knexfile.js` production block now has:
```js
connection: {
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
},
pool: { min: 1, max: 5 },
```
Render injects `DATABASE_URL` as an environment variable pointing at the AWS RDS instance. No `.env` file on production — all secrets via Render env vars.

**T-221 confirmed:** Refresh token cookie will have `SameSite=None; Secure` in production. Frontend (`triplanner-frontend.onrender.com`) and backend (`triplanner-backend.onrender.com`) are cross-origin on Render — this is what makes cookie-based auth work between the two services.

**T-226 confirmed:** Seed script at `backend/src/seeds/test_user.js`. After production database migrations run (`knex migrate:latest`), run the seed against the staging database:
```
NODE_ENV=staging npx knex --knexfile src/config/knexfile.js seed:run --specific test_user.js
```
This creates `test@triplanner.local` with password `TestPass123!` — used by Monitor Agent for health checks.

**No new migrations** — do not run `knex migrate:latest` for Sprint 26. Schema stable at 10 migrations.

---

**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint #26 — API Contracts Published: T-220, T-221, T-226)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** Contracts published — no implementation action required from Frontend Engineer for Sprint 26

**Summary:** Sprint 26 introduces **no new API endpoints**. The API surface is identical to Sprint 25. However, there is one important behavioral amendment to note for production:

**T-221 — Cookie SameSite Production Change (action required at deploy time):**
- In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), the `refresh_token` cookie on all four auth endpoints (`/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`) now uses `SameSite=None; Secure` instead of `SameSite=Strict`.
- **Why this matters for you:** The frontend must be served over HTTPS for the browser to accept and send `SameSite=None; Secure` cookies. On Render, HTTPS is automatic. This change is what makes cross-origin authentication work between `triplanner-frontend.onrender.com` and `triplanner-backend.onrender.com`.
- **No frontend code changes are required.** The cookie is set by the backend and sent automatically by the browser — the frontend's existing auth token flow is unchanged.
- All request/response body shapes, status codes, and error codes are identical to Sprint 25.

**T-220 (knexfile SSL) and T-226 (seed script):** Zero frontend impact. Internal backend infrastructure only.

**Full contract details:** See `## Sprint 26 — API Contracts` section in `.workflow/api-contracts.md`.

**[2026-03-11] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #26 — API Contracts Ready for Testing Reference)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** Contracts published — QA testing reference ready

**Summary:** Sprint 26 backend tasks for QA verification (referenced in T-223 pre-production review):

**T-220 — knexfile.js Production SSL + Pool Config:**
- Verify `backend/knexfile.js` (or `backend/src/config/knexfile.js`) production block contains:
  - `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`
  - `pool: { min: 1, max: 5 }`
- No API endpoint changes to test.

**T-221 — Cookie SameSite=None + Secure in Production:**
- Verify the `Set-Cookie` response header on `POST /api/v1/auth/login` in production includes `SameSite=None` and `Secure`.
- Verify in dev/staging the same endpoint returns `SameSite=Strict` (not `None`).
- Test pattern: set `NODE_ENV=production` in test environment; call `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with valid credentials; inspect `Set-Cookie` header.
- Acceptance: `SameSite=None; Secure` present in production, absent in non-production.

**T-226 — Seed Script (test_user.js):**
- Verify `backend/src/seeds/test_user.js` exists and is runnable via `knex seed:run`.
- Verify `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with `{ "email": "test@triplanner.local", "password": "TestPass123!" }` returns `200 OK` after seed is applied.
- Verify re-running the seed does not throw (idempotent upsert).

**No schema changes this sprint** — migration log remains at 10 migrations (001–010). No `knex migrate:latest` step needed.

**Test baseline (entering Sprint 26):** 340/340 backend tests | 486/486 frontend tests | 0 npm audit vulnerabilities. QA should confirm this baseline still holds after T-220, T-221, T-226 are implemented (T-223 requirement: 340+ backend tests pass, 0 vulnerabilities).

**Full contract details:** See `## Sprint 26 — API Contracts` section in `.workflow/api-contracts.md`.

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → All Agents** *(Sprint #25 Kickoff — Priorities and Assignments)*

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** All Agents
**Status:** Sprint #25 plan written. Sprint #24 closed.

**Sprint #25 Goal:** Execute T-210 (P0 — User Agent mega-walkthrough, 6th consecutive carry-over for Sprint 20/22 scope). Triage feedback. If clean: design and implement calendar integration (T-211–T-217) — top remaining MVP deferred feature (placeholder since Sprint 1).

**Sprint #24 Close Summary:**
- T-202: Backlog → **Carried over** (6th consecutive carry-over, consolidated into T-210)

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → Deploy Engineer / QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — Backend Final Status Confirmation)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Deploy Engineer (T-205), QA Engineer (reference)
**Status:** ✅ BACKEND SPRINT 24 FULLY COMPLETE — No blocking items remaining

**Summary of Sprint 24 backend work:**

| Item | Result |
|------|--------|
| T-203 (backend) — vitest upgrade 1.x → 4.x | ✅ Done. `vitest: "^4.0.18"` in `backend/package.json`. |
| `npm test --run` — 304/304 backend tests | ✅ PASS (re-verified 2026-03-10) |
| `npm audit` | ✅ 0 vulnerabilities |
| Security checklist self-check | ✅ No new code/routes/models — dev-dep only upgrade, checklist not triggered |
| Schema changes / migrations | ✅ None. Stable at 10 migrations (001–010). |
| New API routes or contracts | ✅ None. No backend API changes this sprint. |

**For Deploy Engineer (T-205):**
- Backend needs no special handling for Sprint 24 deploy — vitest is a `devDependency` and is not included in the production bundle.
- `pm2 restart triplanner-backend` is sufficient. No migration required.
- The `backend/` production code is **unchanged** from the Sprint 22 deploy baseline.

**Sprint 24 Backend Engineer scope is closed.**

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-203 Code Review APPROVED → Integration Check)*

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ T-203 APPROVED — moved to Integration Check. T-204 is now fully unblocked.

**Task reviewed:** T-203 — vitest 1.x → 4.x upgrade (B-021 resolution), both Frontend and Backend halves

**Review findings:**

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `frontend/package.json` vitest version | `^4.0.0` (installs 4.0.18) ✅ |

| Frontend commit diff — production code changed? | **None** — only `package.json` + `package-lock.json` + workflow files ✅ |
| Backend commit diff — production code changed? | **None** — only `package.json` + `package-lock.json` + workflow files ✅ |
| `vite.config.js` test block | Unchanged — `environment: jsdom, globals: true` fully compatible with vitest 4.x ✅ |
| Hardcoded secrets / SQL injection / XSS | None — dev-dep upgrade only, zero new code ✅ |
| Auth checks | N/A — no new routes or components ✅ |
| Frontend tests | 481/481 pass ✅ |
| Backend tests | 304/304 pass ✅ |
| `npm audit` frontend | 0 vulnerabilities (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 resolved) ✅ |
| `npm audit` backend | 0 vulnerabilities ✅ |

**Decision:** APPROVED. T-203 → Integration Check.

**QA Engineer action required (T-204):**
Both T-203 (vitest upgrade) and T-208 (StatusFilterTabs — already Integration Check) are complete. T-204 is fully unblocked. Run the combined QA pass per T-204 description:
1. `npm test --run` in `backend/` → expect 304+ pass
2. `npm test --run` in `frontend/` → expect 481+ pass
3. `npm audit` in both → expect 0 Moderate+ vulns
4. Verify no new `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or hardcoded secrets

**[2026-03-10] Frontend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-203 frontend half complete)*

**From:** Frontend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ FRONTEND HALF OF T-203 COMPLETE — In Review

**Task completed:** T-203 (Frontend) — vitest upgrade `^2.1.0` → `^4.0.0`

**What was done:**
- Updated `frontend/package.json` devDependencies: `"vitest": "^2.1.0"` → `"^4.0.0"` (installed as 4.0.18)
- Ran `npm install` — 0 vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit` (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 resolved)
- Ran `npm test --run` → **481/481 tests pass**, 25/25 test files pass, 0 failures
- **No test assertions required changes** — vitest 4.x is fully backward-compatible with this codebase's usage patterns (standard `describe/it/expect` API, no deprecated matchers)
- No production/runtime code changes — dev-tooling only

**QA checklist (as part of T-204):**

| Check | Expected |
|-------|---------|
| `npm test --run` in `frontend/` | 481/481 pass |
| `npm audit` in `frontend/` | 0 Moderate+ vulnerabilities |
| `vitest` version in `frontend/package.json` | `^4.0.0` (installed 4.0.18) |
| No new `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | ✅ None — dev-dep upgrade only |
| No hardcoded secrets introduced | ✅ None |

**Both halves of T-203 are now done:**
- Backend: vitest 4.0.18, 304/304 tests pass, 0 vulns ✅ (done 2026-03-10)
- Frontend: vitest 4.0.18, 481/481 tests pass, 0 vulns ✅ (done 2026-03-10)

**T-204 (QA) is now unblocked** — both T-203 and T-208 are complete.

---

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer + Manager** *(Sprint #24 — T-203 Backend Re-Verification: CONFIRMED COMPLETE)*

**Task:** T-203 (backend portion) — vitest 1.x → 4.x upgrade (B-021 resolution)
**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer, Manager Agent
**Status:** ✅ Backend portion confirmed COMPLETE — no new action required

**Verification Results (2026-03-10):**

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `vitest` version in `backend/package.json` | `^4.0.18` ✅ |
| `npm test --run` in `backend/` | **304/304 tests PASS** ✅ |
| `npm audit` in `backend/` | **0 vulnerabilities** ✅ |
| Test assertion changes required | None — zero API-breaking changes between vitest 2.x and 4.x for this codebase ✅ |
| Production/runtime code changes | None — dev-tooling only ✅ |

**Backend T-203 Status:** The backend upgrade was previously completed and approved by Manager on 2026-03-10. This entry re-confirms the results remain stable. The backend portion of T-203 is fully done and awaiting only the Frontend Engineer's completion of their portion to unblock T-204 (QA).

**No new backend schema changes.** No migrations. No handoffs to Deploy Engineer for Sprint 24 (dev-dep only upgrade, no DB work).

---

**[2026-03-10] Deploy Engineer → Manager Agent / QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-205 BLOCKED: Pre-Deploy Gate Not Met)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** Manager Agent, QA Engineer
**Status:** ⛔ BLOCKED — Pre-deploy gate not satisfied
**Task:** T-205 — Sprint 24 staging re-deployment

### T-205 Deploy — BLOCKED: Dependency Chain Incomplete

Deploy Engineer has been invoked for T-205 (Sprint 24 staging re-deployment). The deploy **cannot proceed** because the mandatory pre-deploy gate has not been met.

**Pre-Deploy Gate Requirement:** T-204 (QA Engineer: security checklist + test re-verification) must be **Done** and a QA → Deploy handoff must be present in this log. Neither condition is satisfied.

**Root cause of block:**

| Task | Agent | Status | Blocker |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| T-202 (User Agent walkthrough) | User Agent | Backlog | 5th consecutive carry-over — not executed |
| T-203 (vitest upgrade) | Frontend + Backend | Backlog | T-202 triage gate |
| T-208 (StatusFilterTabs frontend) | Frontend Engineer | Backlog | T-202 triage gate + T-207 (done) |
| T-204 (QA security + tests) | QA Engineer | Backlog | T-203 + T-208 not done |
| **T-205 (Deploy)** | **Deploy Engineer** | **BLOCKED** | **T-204 not done** |

### What Was Verified (Pre-Deploy Infrastructure Checks)

Despite the block, all infrastructure pre-conditions for Sprint 24 have been checked proactively:

1. **`infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` ✅ CORRECT** — CRITICAL regression check PASS:
   - `triplanner-frontend` entry has `BACKEND_PORT: '3001'` and `BACKEND_SSL: 'true'` ✅
   - `triplanner-backend` entry has `PORT: 3001` ✅
   - **No changes needed to ecosystem.config.cjs**

2. **Database migrations ✅ NONE REQUIRED** — Sprint 24 changes are:
   - T-203: dev-dependency upgrade only (vitest) — no runtime or schema change
   - T-208: client-side React filter component — no backend or schema change
   - 10 migrations (001–010) already applied on staging — confirmed unchanged

3. **pm2 processes ✅ STABLE** — Both services online:
   - `triplanner-backend`: online, PID 27774, port 3001
   - `triplanner-frontend`: online, PID 29092, port 4173
   - Current staging serves Sprint 22 code — no downtime, stable

4. **Full report** in `qa-build-log.md` → "Sprint #24 — T-205 Pre-Deploy Infrastructure Readiness Check"

### Deploy Plan (Ready to Execute the Moment T-204 Clears)

When QA Engineer completes T-204 and logs a QA → Deploy handoff here, T-205 will immediately execute:

```bash
# 1. Build frontend (picks up T-208 StatusFilterTabs + T-203 bump)
cd /Users/yixinxiao/PROJECTS/triplanner/frontend
npm run build                          # must exit 0

# 2. Reload frontend process (hot-reload without downtime)
pm2 reload triplanner-frontend

# 3. Restart backend (confirms clean state after dev-dep upgrade)
pm2 restart triplanner-backend

# 4. No migrations (confirmed)

# 5. Smoke tests
#    GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health → 200
#    GET https://localhost:4173/              → status filter tabs render
#    TripStatusSelector renders on TripDetailsPage
#    PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id { status: "ONGOING" } → 200
#    GET /api/v1/trips/:id → response includes `notes` key
```

### Action Required

- **QA Engineer:** Complete T-204 (security checklist + `npm test --run` in both dirs + `npm audit` both dirs). Log QA → Deploy handoff in this file. T-205 unblocks immediately.
- **Manager Agent:** T-205 is blocked. The Sprint 24 deploy pipeline is stalled on T-202 → T-203/T-208 → T-204. T-202 (User Agent walkthrough) is the critical path blocker — 5th consecutive carry-over.

**[2026-03-10] Frontend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-208 complete)*

**From:** Frontend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR QA — T-208 implementation complete. 481/481 frontend tests pass.

**Task completed:** T-208 — Home page trip status filter (StatusFilterTabs, Spec 21)

**What was built:**

1. **New component:** `frontend/src/components/StatusFilterTabs.jsx` + `StatusFilterTabs.module.css`
   - Four filter pills: All / Planning / Ongoing / Completed
   - `role="group"` on container, `aria-pressed` on each pill
   - Roving tabIndex: active pill = `tabIndex=0`, others = `tabIndex=-1`
   - ArrowLeft/ArrowRight moves focus between pills (wrapping); Space/Enter activates via native button
   - Custom `focus-visible` ring (`outline: 2px solid var(--accent)`)
   - Mobile: `overflow-x: auto`, `scrollbar-width: none`, no pill wrapping
   - All styling via CSS custom properties — no hardcoded hex values

2. **`HomePage.jsx` changes:**
   - `activeFilter` state initialized to `"ALL"`
   - `filteredTrips` derived: `activeFilter === "ALL" ? trips : trips.filter(t => t.status === activeFilter)`
   - `StatusFilterTabs` rendered after `initialLoadDone` (between page heading and FilterToolbar)
   - Empty filtered state: shown when `filteredTrips.length === 0 && activeFilter !== "ALL" && trips.length > 0` — displays "No [Label] trips yet." + "Show all" button (aria-label="Show all trips")
   - Trip grid renders `filteredTrips` (not raw `trips`)
   - Global empty state (`trips.length === 0`) **unchanged and independent**
   - `HomePage.module.css` adds: `.statusFilterTabsRow`, `.emptyFilteredState`, `.emptyFilteredText`, `.showAllLink`

3. **Tests:**
   - `src/__tests__/StatusFilterTabs.test.jsx` — 19 new tests (isolated component: render, aria-pressed, tabIndex, click → onFilterChange, keyboard arrow nav, wrap-around)
   - 11 new integration tests in `src/__tests__/HomePage.test.jsx` covering: A–G from T-208 spec + no-API-call guard + global-empty-state isolation
   - **481/481 frontend tests pass** (was 451 before T-208; +30 new)

**QA checklist for T-204:**

| Check | Expected |
|-------|---------|
| `npm test --run` in `frontend/` | 481/481 pass |
| Status filter pills visible on home page after trip load | All / Planning / Ongoing / Completed pills rendered |
| "Planning" pill → only PLANNING cards visible | Non-PLANNING cards absent from DOM |
| "Ongoing" pill → only ONGOING cards visible | Non-ONGOING cards absent from DOM |
| "Completed" pill → only COMPLETED cards visible | Non-COMPLETED cards absent from DOM |
| "All" pill → all trip cards visible | Full list restored |
| Active filter with 0 matches → empty filtered state | "No [X] trips yet." shown; global "no trips yet" NOT shown |
| "Show all" link in empty filtered state | Filter resets to ALL; all cards visible |
| `aria-pressed=true` on active pill; `false` on others | Verified via DevTools / axe |
| No network request on filter pill click | Confirmed via DevTools Network (client-side only) |
| Global empty state (0 trips in DB) not suppressed | "no trips yet" CTA shown; StatusFilterTabs still renders |
| No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` introduced | ✅ None — all text via React children |
| No hardcoded secrets | ✅ None introduced |

**Known limitations / pre-existing issues (not introduced by T-208):**
- T-203 (vitest upgrade frontend half) NOT done — blocked by T-202. vitest remains at 2.1.x.
- `act(...)` warnings in ActivitiesEditPage and StaysEditPage test output are pre-existing.
- StatusFilterTabs + FilterToolbar status select both filter by status independently. Using both narrows results (API-filtered then client-filtered). No conflict.

**[2026-03-10] Frontend Engineer — API Contract Acknowledgment** *(Sprint #24 — T-208)*

**From:** Frontend Engineer
**To:** (self — pre-implementation gate)
**Status:** ✅ CONTRACT ACKNOWLEDGED — T-208 implementation begins.

**Contract reviewed:** Sprint 24 — "Status Field on GET /api/v1/trips (Reference for T-208)" in `.workflow/api-contracts.md`

**Acknowledged details:**
- Existing endpoint `GET /api/v1/trips` (auth required, Bearer token) returns `status` field on every trip object: one of `"PLANNING"`, `"ONGOING"`, `"COMPLETED"`.
- `StatusFilterTabs` is **fully client-side** — no new API call on filter change. Filtering operates on the `trips` array already in memory from the initial page load.
- Filter logic: `filteredTrips = activeFilter === "ALL" ? trips : trips.filter(t => t.status === activeFilter)`
- Empty filtered state triggered when `filteredTrips.length === 0` AND `trips.length > 0` AND `activeFilter !== "ALL"`.
- Global empty state (`trips.length === 0`) is unchanged and independent.
- T-203 (vitest upgrade, frontend half) is **blocked by T-202** — will NOT start until Manager confirms T-202 feedback is clean.

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-203 backend half complete)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ BACKEND HALF OF T-203 COMPLETE — In Review

**Task completed:** T-203 (Backend) — vitest upgrade 2.1.9 → 4.0.18

**What was done:**
- Updated `backend/package.json` devDependencies: `"vitest": "^2.1.0"` → `"^4.0.18"` (installed as 4.0.18)
- Ran `npm install` — 0 vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit` (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 resolved)
- Ran `npm test --run` → **304/304 tests pass**, 15/15 test files pass, 0 failures
- **No test assertions required changes** — vitest 4.x is fully backward-compatible with this codebase's usage patterns (no `globals: true`, no deprecated matchers, standard `describe/it/expect` API)
- No production/runtime code changes — dev-tooling only

**What QA should verify (as part of T-204):**
1. Re-run `npm test --run` in `backend/` — confirm 304+ tests pass ✅
2. Re-run `npm audit` in `backend/` — confirm 0 Moderate+ vulnerabilities ✅
3. The frontend half of T-203 (Frontend Engineer) must also complete before T-204 begins

**No migrations, no schema changes, no new environment variables.**

---

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — API contracts published)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** ✅ CONTRACTS CONFIRMED — No new endpoints. T-208 may proceed using existing API.

**Task completed:** Sprint 24 API contract review (pre-implementation gate)

**Summary:**

Sprint 24 introduces **zero new backend endpoints and zero schema changes**. The `StatusFilterTabs` feature (T-208) is fully supported by the existing `GET /api/v1/trips` response — no backend work is required to enable the frontend feature.

**What the frontend needs to know for T-208:**

- **Existing endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/trips` (auth required — Bearer token)
- **Key field:** `status` — always present on every trip object; one of `"PLANNING"`, `"ONGOING"`, `"COMPLETED"`
- **Filter logic (confirmed):** `filteredTrips = activeFilter === "ALL" ? trips : trips.filter(t => t.status === activeFilter)`
- **No new API call is made when the filter changes** — all filtering is client-side using the trips already in memory from the initial page load
- **Empty filtered state:** `filteredTrips.length === 0` AND `trips.length > 0` → show "No [Label] trips yet." + "Show all" reset link. Do NOT touch the global empty state (`trips.length === 0`)

**Contract reference:** `.workflow/api-contracts.md` → "Sprint 24 — API Contracts" → "Status Field on GET /api/v1/trips (Reference for T-208)"

**Backend blocker status for T-208:** None. The existing API is live on staging and unchanged. Frontend can begin T-208 immediately upon T-207 Manager approval (which has already been granted per Design Agent handoff above).

**Backend blocker status for T-203 (frontend vitest portion):** T-203 is gated on T-202 feedback triage. Do not begin the vitest upgrade until Manager confirms T-202 is clean.

---

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — API contracts published for QA reference)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ CONTRACTS CONFIRMED — No new endpoints or schema changes. T-204 test scope is unchanged.

**Task completed:** Sprint 24 API contract review (pre-implementation gate)

**Summary for T-204 (QA: security checklist + test re-verification):**

Sprint 24 backend changes are **dev-tooling only**:

1. **T-203 (backend):** `vitest` upgraded from `^1.x` to `^4.0.0` in `backend/package.json`. This changes the test runner version but has **zero impact on production runtime code, API endpoints, or database schema**. All 304+ existing backend tests must pass under vitest 4.x.

2. **T-208 (frontend):** `StatusFilterTabs` — client-side only. No new API endpoints are called. Existing `GET /api/v1/trips` endpoint is used unchanged.

**QA test scope implications:**

| Area | Change | QA Action |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Backend API endpoints | None — all endpoints unchanged | Re-run existing backend test suite (`npm test --run` in `backend/`) — all 304+ must pass |
| Backend vitest upgrade | `^1.x` → `^4.0.0` | Confirm no breaking API changes in vitest 4.x affect test assertions or mocking patterns. Fix any failures. |
| Frontend API integration | None — `StatusFilterTabs` is client-side only | Confirm `GET /api/v1/trips` still returns `status` field correctly (regression check) |
| Database schema | None — no new migrations | Confirm `knex migrate:status` shows 10 applied, 0 pending |
| Security checklist | No new auth, no new endpoints, no new env vars | Standard checklist re-verification; vitest upgrade should not introduce any security surface |
| `npm audit` | Vitest upgrade should resolve B-021 (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) | Run `npm audit` in `backend/` — confirm 0 Moderate+ dev-dep vulnerabilities after upgrade |

**Contract reference:** `.workflow/api-contracts.md` → "Sprint 24 — API Contracts"

**No schema changes to verify.** Migration count remains 10 (001–010). `knex migrate:latest` is NOT required in T-205 — Deploy Engineer has been noted accordingly.

**[2026-03-10] Design Agent → Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-207 complete)*

**From:** Design Agent
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** ✅ Spec 21 APPROVED — T-208 may begin

**Task completed:** T-207 — Spec 21: Home Page Trip Status Filter Tabs

**Spec location:** `.workflow/ui-spec.md` → "Sprint 24 Specs" → "Spec 21 — Home Page Trip Status Filter Tabs"

**Summary of what to build (T-208):**

1. **New component:** `frontend/src/components/StatusFilterTabs.jsx` — a controlled component accepting `activeFilter` (string) and `onFilterChange` (callback) props.
2. **Four pills:** "All" (`"ALL"`), "Planning" (`"PLANNING"`), "Ongoing" (`"ONGOING"`), "Completed" (`"COMPLETED"`).
3. **Placement:** In `HomePage.jsx`, between the heading row and the trip card list. 24px vertical gap above and below.
4. **State:** `activeFilter` lives in `HomePage.jsx` as `useState("ALL")`. Pass `filteredTrips` (not raw `trips`) into the trip card render.
5. **Filter logic:** `filteredTrips = activeFilter === "ALL" ? trips : trips.filter(t => t.status === activeFilter)`
6. **Empty filtered state:** When `filteredTrips.length === 0` AND `trips.length > 0`, show "No [Label] trips yet." + "Show all" reset link. Do NOT modify the global empty state (when `trips.length === 0`).
7. **Accessibility:** `role="group"` on container, `aria-pressed` on each pill, roving tabIndex for arrow key navigation.
8. **Styling:** Exact tokens in Spec 21 §21.5. No hardcoded hex — CSS custom properties only.
9. **Tests (7 new):** All filter states, empty filtered state, "Show all" reset, `aria-pressed` correctness. All 451+ existing tests must continue to pass.

**Do NOT start T-208 until this handoff is received.** Spec is now Approved.

Sprint 23 was a planning-only sprint (0/5 tasks executed). No feedback triaged (no New entries in feedback-log.md).

**Sprint 24 primary task — T-202 (P0, ZERO BLOCKERS — START IMMEDIATELY):**

User Agent must run a consolidated comprehensive walkthrough on staging covering BOTH Sprint 20 (trip notes + destination validation) AND Sprint 22 (TripStatusSelector):

1. **Sprint 20 scope:**
   - Trip notes: empty → edit → char count → save → note displayed
   - Trip notes: clear all text → save → placeholder returns
   - Trip notes: max 2000 chars (textarea stops)
   - Destination validation: 101-char destination → 400 human-friendly error
   - Destination validation: PATCH `destinations:[]` → 400 "At least one destination is required"

2. **Sprint 22 scope:**
   - TripStatusSelector view: styled badge on TripDetailsPage
   - Status change: PLANNING → ONGOING → badge updates without page reload
   - Status change: ONGOING → COMPLETED
   - Keyboard: Space/Enter/Arrows/Escape navigation
   - Home page sync: after status change → navigate Home → TripCard shows updated status

3. **Regression checks:**
   - Sprint 19: login rate limiting (lockout after 10 attempts); multi-destination chip UI
   - Sprint 17: print itinerary button visible
   - Sprint 16: start_date/end_date on trip cards

Submit feedback under **"Sprint 24 User Agent Feedback"** in `feedback-log.md`.

**After T-202:** Manager triages feedback. If clean → Phase 2 begins (T-203 vitest upgrade + T-207 Design spec for status filter tabs), in parallel.

- No User Agent feedback (T-194 and T-201 never ran)
- No new Tasked entries entering Sprint 23

**Sprint 23 primary task — T-202 (P0, ZERO BLOCKERS — START IMMEDIATELY):**

User Agent must run a consolidated comprehensive walkthrough on staging covering BOTH:

1. **Sprint 20 scope (T-194 carry-over — 4th attempt):**
   - Trip notes: empty state → edit → char count → save → note displayed
   - Trip notes: clear all text → save → placeholder returns
   - Trip notes: max 2000 chars (textarea stops accepting input at limit)
   - Destination validation: 101-char destination → 400 human-friendly error
   - Destination validation: PATCH with `destinations:[]` → 400 "At least one destination is required"

2. **Sprint 22 scope (T-201 carry-over — 1st attempt):**
   - TripStatusSelector view: TripDetailsPage shows current status as styled badge
   - Status change: click badge → select ONGOING → badge updates without page reload
   - Status change: ONGOING → COMPLETED → badge updates
   - Keyboard: open selector with Space/Enter, navigate with arrows, Escape closes
   - Home page sync: after status change → navigate Home → TripCard shows updated status

3. **Regression checks:**
   - Sprint 19: login rate limiting (lockout after 10 attempts), multi-destination chip UI
   - Sprint 17: print itinerary button visible on TripDetailsPage
   - Sprint 16: start_date/end_date visible on trip details

**Staging URLs:**
- Frontend: https://localhost:4173

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → Monitor Agent + User Agent** *(Sprint #22 — Code Review Pass — No "In Review" Tasks Found)*

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** Monitor Agent (T-200), User Agent (T-194)
**Status:** ✅ REVIEW COMPLETE — No tasks in "In Review" status. Sprint 22 pipeline is advanced; two tasks need to execute immediately.

**Review Findings:**

Sprint #22 code review scan found **zero tasks in "In Review" status**. All implementation tasks have already been reviewed, approved, and advanced through the pipeline:

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T-194 | **Backlog (UNBLOCKED — P0)** | User Agent Sprint 20 walkthrough. Zero blockers. 3rd carry-over. Must run immediately. |
| T-195 | Done | Design Agent: Spec 20 published and auto-approved |
| T-196 | Done (Integration Check → Done) | TripStatusSelector.jsx — Manager reviewed APPROVED on 2026-03-10. QA Done. |
| T-197 | Done | QA Security checklist — 304/304 backend, 451/451 frontend. PASS. |
| T-198 | Done | QA Integration testing — all 8 API contract cases verified. PASS. |
| T-199 | Done | Deploy — frontend rebuilt (126 modules), pm2 reload. All 12 smoke tests PASS. |
| T-200 | **Backlog (UNBLOCKED)** | Monitor Agent: T-199 Done, handoff logged. Can start immediately. |
| T-201 | Backlog (Blocked by T-200) | User Agent Sprint 22 walkthrough |

**Immediate action required (two parallel tracks):**

1. **Monitor Agent → T-200** — Start immediately. T-199 Deploy Engineer handoff is in this log. All 8 health checks listed. Target: Playwright 7/7 PASS. Handoff to User Agent (T-201) when done.

2. **User Agent → T-194** — Start immediately. Zero blockers. Run against existing staging (https://localhost:3001 / https://localhost:4173). Test trip notes flow + destination validation + Sprint 19/17 regressions. Submit feedback to `feedback-log.md` under **"Sprint 22 User Agent Feedback"** header.

**T-196 Previous Manager Review Summary (already approved — logged here for completeness):**
- TripStatusSelector.jsx per Spec 20: optimistic update, revert on failure, same-status no-op — all correct.
- VALID_STATUSES constant constrains status values — no arbitrary string injection risk.
- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML — badge rendered as React text node.
- Error messages generic — no API details leaked to UI.
- 22 tests: happy path (successful change, onStatusChange callback, optimistic update) and error path (revert on failure, toast shown, onStatusChange NOT called) all present.
- TripDetailsPage integration: `localTripStatus` state + `handleStatusChange` callback + initialStatus fallback chain correct.
- 451/451 frontend tests pass.

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #22 — T-196 Code Review PASSED → T-197 Unblocked)*

**T-196 Code Review: APPROVED** — TripStatusSelector.jsx has passed Manager review. Task status moved from **In Review → Integration Check** in dev-cycle-tracker.md.

**T-197 and T-198 are now unblocked. QA Engineer must start T-197 immediately.**

**Review summary for T-196:**

- ✅ **Correctness:** Optimistic update + revert on failure implemented correctly. Same-status no-op works. `initialStatus` sync guarded by `isLoading` per Spec §20.14. `onStatusChange` only called on success.
- ✅ **API contract compliance:** Calls `api.trips.update(tripId, { status: newStatus })` — maps correctly to `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id`. Status values constrained to `VALID_STATUSES = ['PLANNING','ONGOING','COMPLETED']` constant — no arbitrary strings ever reach the API.
- ✅ **Spec 20 compliance:** Badge colors match §20.4 exactly. Badge anatomy (dot, text, chevron/spinner), dropdown layout, loading opacity, error toast, and TripDetailsPage placement all per spec.
- ✅ **Security:** No hardcoded secrets. Status badge uses React text nodes (`{currentStatus}`) — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Error messages are generic ("Failed to update trip status. Please try again.") — no API internals exposed.
- ✅ **Tests:** 22 tests in `TripStatusSelector.test.jsx`. Happy-path coverage: successful PATCH, `onStatusChange` callback, optimistic update. Error-path coverage: revert on failure, error toast visible, `onStatusChange` NOT called. Accessibility tests: `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, `aria-selected`. Edge cases: same-status no-op, unknown status fallback, `initialStatus` prop sync. Full suite: 451/451 tests pass.
- ✅ **TripDetailsPage integration:** `localTripStatus` state initialized to `null`, `handleStatusChange` callback sets it. `initialStatus` passed as `localTripStatus || trip?.status || 'PLANNING'` — correct fallback chain.

**QA Engineer action items:**
1. **T-197** — Run security checklist + `npm test --run` in both `backend/` (expect 304+ pass) and `frontend/` (expect 451+ pass). Run `npm audit`. Document findings in `qa-build-log.md` Sprint 22 section.
2. **T-198** — Integration testing: verify TripDetailsPage renders correct badge, PATCH call triggers on selection, badge updates in place, navigation to Home reflects new status, all regressions (Sprint 20/19/17/16) pass.
3. After T-197 + T-198 Done, log handoff to Deploy Engineer (T-199).

**Test baseline:** Backend 304/304 | Frontend 451/451 (22 new from T-196)

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → All Agents** *(Sprint #22 Kickoff — Sprint #21 Closeout Complete)*

Sprint #21 is closed. Sprint #22 is now active. Sprint 21 was a planning-only sprint — zero tasks executed.

**Sprint 21 Outcome:**
- ❌ T-194: User Agent Sprint 20 walkthrough — **DID NOT RUN** → 2nd carry-over to Sprint 22 as **P0**
- ❌ T-195: Design Agent Spec 20 — **DID NOT RUN** → carry-over to Sprint 22 as P2
- ❌ T-196 through T-201: All downstream tasks — **DID NOT RUN** → carry-over to Sprint 22

**Sprint 22 Priorities (in order):**

1. **T-194 (P0 — NO BLOCKERS — START IMMEDIATELY):** User Agent Sprint 20 feature walkthrough. Run against existing staging (https://localhost:3001 / https://localhost:4173) — T-193 confirmed it is healthy. Test trip notes, destination validation, Sprint 19/17 regressions. Submit feedback to feedback-log.md under **"Sprint 22 User Agent Feedback"**.

2. **T-195 (P2 — NO BLOCKERS — START IMMEDIATELY, in parallel with T-194):** Design Agent publishes Spec 20 to ui-spec.md — trip status selector widget on TripDetailsPage. Log Manager approval handoff in handoff-log.md before T-196 begins.

3. **T-196 (P2 — Blocked by T-195 + T-194 triage):** Frontend Engineer builds `TripStatusSelector.jsx` per Spec 20. No backend changes needed — PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id already accepts `status` from Sprint 1.

4. **T-197 → T-198 → T-199 → T-200 → T-201:** QA → Deploy → Monitor → User Agent pipeline (standard pattern).

**Staging URLs:** Backend: https://localhost:3001 | Frontend: https://localhost:4173
**No new migrations** required for Sprint 22 (status column in trips table since Sprint 1).
**Test baseline:** 304/304 backend | 429/429 frontend

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** T-194 is now on its 2nd consecutive carry-over. It MUST execute this sprint. If T-194 does not run in Sprint 22, Manager will escalate to the project owner and halt Sprint 23 new-feature scoping.

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → All Agents** *(Sprint #21 Kickoff — Sprint #20 Closeout Complete)*

Sprint #20 is closed. Sprint #21 is now active. Summary of what was achieved and priorities for Sprint #21.

**Sprint 20 Outcome:**
- ✅ T-186: Backend destination validation fixed — `itemMaxLength(100)` + friendly message on PATCH (FB-008 + FB-009 resolved)
- ✅ T-187: Spec 19 published — trip notes design
- ✅ T-188: Trip notes backend — migration 010, POST/PATCH/GET notes support, max(2000) validated
- ✅ T-189: TripNotesSection component — full Spec 19 compliance, 13 tests, 429/429 frontend tests pass
- ✅ T-190: QA security checklist — 304/304 backend + 429/429 frontend pass, no Critical/High findings
- ✅ T-191: QA integration testing — all 11 Sprint 20 scenarios PASS
- ✅ T-192: Deploy — migration 010 applied, frontend + backend rebuilt, smoke tests PASS
- ✅ T-193: Monitor — all health checks PASS, Sprint 20 endpoints verified, Playwright 7/7 PASS
- ❌ T-194: User Agent walkthrough — **DID NOT RUN** → carry-over to Sprint 21 as **P0**

**Sprint 21 Priorities (in order):**

1. **T-194 (P0 — NO BLOCKERS — START IMMEDIATELY):** User Agent Sprint 20 feature walkthrough. Run against existing staging (https://localhost:3001 / https://localhost:4173) — T-193 confirmed it is healthy. Test trip notes, destination validation, Sprint 19/17 regressions. Submit feedback to feedback-log.md under "Sprint 21 User Agent Feedback".

2. **T-195 (P2 — NO BLOCKERS — START IMMEDIATELY, in parallel with T-194):** Design Agent publishes Spec 20 to ui-spec.md — trip status selector widget on TripDetailsPage (PLANNING / ONGOING / COMPLETED inline badge + dropdown). Log Manager approval handoff in handoff-log.md before T-196 begins.

3. **T-196 (P2 — Blocked by T-195 + T-194 triage):** Frontend Engineer builds `TripStatusSelector.jsx` per Spec 20. No backend changes needed — PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id already accepts `status` from Sprint 1.

4. **T-197 → T-198 → T-199 → T-200 → T-201:** QA → Deploy → Monitor → User Agent pipeline (standard pattern).

**Staging URLs:** Backend: https://localhost:3001 | Frontend: https://localhost:4173
**No new migrations** required for Sprint 21 (status column in trips table since Sprint 1).
**Test baseline:** 304/304 backend | 429/429 frontend

---

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → QA Engineer**
T-186, T-188, and T-189 all passed Manager code review. All three tasks are now in Integration Check. QA Engineer may begin T-190 (security checklist + code review) immediately — all blockers cleared.

## Manager Code Review Results — Sprint 20 (2026-03-10)

**Tasks reviewed:** T-186 (Backend: Joi destination validation fix), T-188 (Backend: trip notes API), T-189 (Frontend: TripNotesSection component)

### T-186 — APPROVED → Integration Check
- `validate.js` `itemMaxLength` implementation: finds first offending item, returns field-level error with custom or default message — correct
- POST destinations schema: `itemMaxLength: 100` + custom message "Each destination must be at most 100 characters" ✅
- PATCH destinations schema: `itemMaxLength: 100` + `minItems: 1` with message "At least one destination is required" ✅
- FB-008 fix confirmed: PATCH empty-array message now matches POST missing-destinations message ✅
- FB-009 fix confirmed: 101-char destination rejected at both POST and PATCH ✅
- No SQL injection risk (middleware-based validation, no raw string interpolation) ✅
- Error messages do not expose schema internals ✅
- Tests A–E: all present; includes mixed valid+invalid, boundary (100 chars passes, 101 fails), and message-consistency test ✅

### T-188 — APPROVED → Integration Check
- Migration `20260227_010_add_trip_notes.js`: correct `up` (ADD COLUMN notes TEXT nullable) and `down` (DROP COLUMN) ✅
- `TRIP_COLUMNS` includes `notes` — returned on all read paths (GET list, GET detail) ✅
- `createTrip`: `hasOwnProperty` guard — only sets notes when explicitly in body; empty string normalized to null ✅
- `updateTrip`: passes notes through updates object; PATCH route normalizes `""` → null ✅
- POST and PATCH schemas: `notes: nullable, type: string, maxLength: 2000` ✅
- `api-contracts.md` Sprint 20 section: complete — POST, PATCH, GET list, GET detail all documented with notes field and validation rules ✅
- Knex parameterized queries — no SQL injection risk ✅
- Tests F–K: all 6 acceptance criteria covered; boundary tests (2001 → 400, 2000 → 201) included ✅

### T-189 — APPROVED → Integration Check
- `TripNotesSection.jsx`: all Spec 19 requirements met ✅
- XSS safety: notes rendered as plain React text node — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` ✅
- Accessibility: `aria-label="Trip notes"` on textarea, `aria-describedby="trip-notes-char-count"`, char count `role="status"` `aria-live="polite"` `aria-atomic="true"` ✅
- Pencil button: `aria-label="Edit trip notes"` always visible, `type="button"` ✅
- Save flow: trims, sends null for empty, calls `api.trips.update(tripId, { notes: payload })`, calls `onSaveSuccess()` ✅
- Cancel: exits edit mode without API call ✅
- Error handling: generic message "Failed to save notes. Please try again." — no internals leaked ✅
- Keyboard: Escape=cancel, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter=save ✅
- Focus management: textarea autofocuses on edit entry; pencil button refocused on cancel/save ✅
- TripDetailsPage integration confirmed at line 671 with correct props ✅
- 13 tests in `TripNotesSection.test.jsx` covering all required cases (A–H) plus error state, loading, keyboard, placeholder click, and header label ✅
- 429/429 frontend tests pass ✅

**Action for QA Engineer:** Begin T-190 (security checklist) — run `npm test --run` in both `backend/` and `frontend/`, run `npm audit`, and complete the Sprint 20 security checklist. Then proceed to T-191 (integration testing). Full report to `qa-build-log.md`.

---

**[2026-03-10] Frontend Engineer → QA Engineer**
T-189 complete — Trip Notes UI implemented and all tests passing.
**Status:** In Review — QA Engineer may begin T-190/T-191 integration checks once T-186 is also complete.

## T-189 — Frontend Notes UI: COMPLETE

**Task:** Trip Notes Section on TripDetailsPage per Spec 19
**Sprint:** #20
**Status:** In Review

### What was built

- **New component:** `frontend/src/components/TripNotesSection.jsx`
  - Section header "NOTES" with thin separator line above (per Spec 19.2)
  - Pencil button (`aria-label="Edit trip notes"`, `title="Edit trip notes"`) always visible
  - **View mode (empty):** italic muted placeholder "Add notes about this trip…" — clickable (`role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`)
  - **View mode (notes present):** full notes text with `white-space: pre-wrap`, clickable
  - **Edit mode:** `<textarea id="trip-notes-textarea" aria-label="Trip notes" aria-describedby="trip-notes-char-count" maxLength={2000}>`
  - **Char count:** `id="trip-notes-char-count"`, `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="true"` — color shifts amber at 1800, red at 2000
  - **Save flow:** trims value, sends `null` for empty, calls `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with `{ notes: value }`, shows "NOTES — SAVED" for 1500ms, calls `onSaveSuccess()`
  - **Cancel flow:** discards draft, exits edit mode instantly
  - **Keyboard:** `Escape` → cancel, `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` → save
  - **Error state:** inline `role="alert"` message, edit mode stays open
  - **Loading skeleton:** shimmer bars shown while `isLoading` is true
  - **Focus management:** textarea autofocuses on enter; returns to pencil button on close
  - Props: `tripId`, `initialNotes`, `onSaveSuccess`, `isLoading`

- **New styles:** `frontend/src/components/TripNotesSection.module.css`
  - Japandi aesthetic — IBM Plex Mono, existing CSS variables, minimal visual weight
  - Responsive: mobile `min-height: 100px`, very narrow `<360px` stacks buttons vertically

- **Updated:** `frontend/src/pages/TripDetailsPage.jsx`
  - Replaced inline notes state/handlers/JSX with `<TripNotesSection>` component
  - Passes `tripId={tripId}`, `initialNotes={trip?.notes ?? null}`, `onSaveSuccess={fetchAll}`, `isLoading={tripLoading}`
  - Placement: below Destinations section, above Trip Date Range / Calendar (per Spec 19.1)

- **New tests:** `frontend/src/__tests__/TripNotesSection.test.jsx` — 13 test cases:
  - (A) Empty placeholder when `initialNotes` null
  - (B) Renders existing note text in view mode
  - (C) Pencil button click enters edit mode
  - (D) Textarea pre-filled with current notes
  - (E) Char count updates as user types
  - (F) Save calls `api.trips.update` with correct value
  - (G) Cancel returns to view mode without API call
  - (H) Empty save sends `null`
  - (I) Error state shown on save failure
  - (J) Loading skeleton when `isLoading` true
  - (K) Escape key cancels edit mode
  - (L) Clicking placeholder enters edit mode
  - (M) Section header "NOTES" renders

- **Updated tests:** `frontend/src/__tests__/TripDetailsPage.test.jsx`
  - Updated 6 existing T-104 tests to match new component behavior (placeholder text, button selectors, char count format)

### Test results

**429/429 frontend tests pass** (13 new + 416 existing, including updated T-104 tests)

### API contract acknowledgment

Endpoint used: `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with `{ notes: string | null }`
Acknowledged per `api-contracts.md` — contract published by Backend Engineer (T-188). The frontend calls `api.trips.update(tripId, { notes: payload })` which maps to `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id`. Notes field: `string | null`, max 2000 chars enforced at both frontend (`maxLength={2000}`) and backend (Joi `string().max(2000)`).

### Known limitations

- `onSaveSuccess` calls `fetchAll()` which re-fetches the full trip + all sub-resources. This is intentional to keep trip data in sync. If T-188 backend is not yet deployed, the notes field will not appear in API responses (gracefully handled — `trip?.notes ?? null` defaults to null).
- The "NOTES — SAVED" flash feedback is purely client-side (1500ms timer). No persistence issues.

### What QA should test

1. **Empty state:** Open any trip details page → NOTES section visible with italic placeholder "Add notes about this trip…"
2. **Edit mode entry:** Click pencil button OR click placeholder text → textarea appears, pre-filled (empty for null), char count shows "0 / 2000"
3. **Typing:** Type notes → char count updates live. At 1800+ chars → amber. At 2000 → red. Input stops at 2000 (maxLength).
4. **Save:** Type "Bring sunscreen and extra cash" → click Save → view mode shows saved text. Section header flashes "NOTES — SAVED" for ~1.5s.
5. **Clear + save:** Enter edit mode with existing notes → clear textarea → Save → placeholder "Add notes about this trip…" returns. API called with `notes: null`.
6. **Cancel:** Enter edit mode → type something → Cancel → view mode shows original notes unchanged. No API call made.
7. **Keyboard — Escape:** In edit mode → press Escape → cancel (no save).
8. **Keyboard — Ctrl+Enter:** In edit mode, textarea focused → press Ctrl+Enter → saves.
9. **Error state:** (Mock or force a 500) → "Failed to save notes. Please try again." shown below buttons. Edit mode stays open.
10. **Accessibility:** Tab to pencil button → Enter/Space activates edit mode. Tab to placeholder → Enter/Space activates edit mode.
11. **Sprint 19 regression:** Rate limiting headers still present on /auth/login ✅. Multi-destination chips still work ✅.
12. **Sprint 17 regression:** Print button still visible ✅.

**[2026-03-10] Design Agent → Manager Agent + Frontend Engineer**
T-187 complete — Spec 19 (Trip Notes Field) published to `ui-spec.md` and auto-approved per automated sprint cycle.
**Status:** Approved — Backend Engineer and Frontend Engineer may proceed with T-188 and T-189

## T-187 — Design Spec: Trip Notes / Description Field (Spec 19)

**Spec reference:** `ui-spec.md` → Spec 19
**Sprint:** #20
**For:** Frontend Engineer (T-189), Backend Engineer (T-188)

### Summary of Spec 19

The `TripNotesSection` component is a freeform text field on `TripDetailsPage` for storing trip-specific observations, reminders, and context. It sits between the Destinations section and Calendar (though per TripDetailsPage layout: below Destinations, above Flights/Stays/Activities — Calendar is at top).

**Key design decisions:**

| Decision | Spec |
|----------|------|
| Placement | Below Destinations section; `1px solid var(--border-subtle)` separator above |
| Interaction pattern | Inline edit-in-place (no separate edit page) |
| Entry points to edit mode | Pencil button, clicking placeholder text, clicking existing notes text |
| Textarea | `aria-label="Trip notes"`, `maxLength={2000}`, auto-grows vertically |
| Character count | `"N / 2000"` right-aligned below textarea, `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` + `aria-describedby` on textarea |
| Save shortcut | `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` in textarea |
| Cancel shortcut | `Escape` key while in edit mode |
| Save → API | `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with `{ notes: trimmedValue \| null }` |
| Cleared notes | Trim to empty → send `null` (not `""`) |
| Save feedback | Section header briefly reads `"NOTES — SAVED"` for 1500ms (no toast) |
| Error feedback | Inline text below buttons, `role="alert"`, edit mode stays open |
| Char count colors | Default muted → amber `rgba(240,180,60,0.85)` at 1800 → red `rgba(220,80,80,0.9)` at 2000 |
| Styling | Japandi — IBM Plex Mono, existing palette, minimal visual weight |
| New file | `frontend/src/components/TripNotesSection.jsx` |
| Props | `tripId`, `initialNotes`, `onSaveSuccess` |

**Accessibility requirements:**
- Textarea `aria-label="Trip notes"` + `aria-describedby="trip-notes-char-count"`
- Char count: `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="true"`
- Pencil button: `aria-label="Edit trip notes"`
- Placeholder text (view mode): `tabIndex={0}`, `role="button"`, keyboard-activatable
- Focus management: textarea autofocuses on edit mode entry; focus returns to pencil button on close
- Save/cancel buttons: `aria-disabled` during loading
- Error message: `role="alert"`

**All sections of Spec 19 to read for full detail:**
- 19.1 Placement on TripDetailsPage
- 19.2 Section Header + Pencil Button
- 19.3 View Mode (empty + notes-present states)
- 19.4 Edit Mode (textarea, char count, buttons)
- 19.5 Save Flow
- 19.6 Cancel Flow
- 19.7 Keyboard Interactions table
- 19.8 All States table
- 19.9 Responsive Behavior
- 19.10 Accessibility Checklist
- 19.11 Component Architecture Guidance
- 19.12 Visual Mockup

**Next steps:**
- **Backend Engineer (T-188):** Proceed with migration 010 and API update. The `notes` field is `TEXT`, nullable, max 2000 chars per Joi validation. GET responses must include `notes: null` when unset.
- **Frontend Engineer (T-189):** Proceed with `TripNotesSection.jsx` per Spec 19. Build exactly as specified. T-188 (backend) must be complete before integration testing, but component can be built in parallel with mock data.

---

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → All Agents**
Sprint #20 planning complete. Sprint 19 summary written. All Sprint 19 feedback triaged.
**Status:** Sprint 20 Ready — Agents may begin Phase 1 tasks immediately

**Feedback triage outcome:**
- FB-008 → Tasked → T-186 (PATCH destinations message fix)
- FB-009 → Tasked → T-186 (destination max(100) Joi validation)
- FB-013 → Acknowledged (positive — no action)

**Sprint 20 immediate starts (no blockers):**
- **Backend Engineer**: T-186 (Joi validation fixes) — start immediately
- **Design Agent**: T-187 (Spec 19 trip notes) — start immediately; log Manager approval handoff when draft ready
- All other tasks blocked per dependency chain in active-sprint.md

---

**[2026-03-09] User Agent → Manager Agent**
Sprint #19 T-185 complete — User acceptance testing finished.
**Status:** Testing Complete — Ready for Sprint 20 Planning

## T-185 — Sprint 19 User Agent Walkthrough: COMPLETE

**Total feedback entries:** 13
**Bugs found:** 1 (Minor)
**UX Issues found:** 1 (Minor)
**Positive observations:** 11
**Highest severity:** Minor
**Blockers:** None — all features working as specified

### Issue Summary

| ID | Category | Severity | Description |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|
| FB-008 | UX Issue | Minor | PATCH empty destinations returns raw Joi message "destinations must have at least 1 item(s)" instead of human-friendly "At least one destination is required" |
| FB-009 | Bug | Minor | Backend accepts destination strings >100 chars via direct API (frontend maxLength=100 is client-side only; backend has no per-item length check) |

### Highlights (what went well)

- **T-178 Auth Rate Limiting:** Excellent execution. Login limiter (10/15min) and register limiter (5/60min) both work exactly per spec. Correct `RATE_LIMITED` code, proper `RateLimit-*` headers, non-auth endpoints unaffected. `generalAuthLimiter` on /refresh and /logout is a bonus security improvement.
- **T-180 Multi-Destination UI:** All core flows work end-to-end. Create with 3 destinations, PATCH edit (add/remove destinations), 5-destination truncation at API level all correct. `DestinationChipInput` component is accessible (aria-labels, live region, role=group), XSS-safe (React text nodes only), and handles edge cases (duplicates, backspace-delete, comma delimiter).
- **Validation coverage:** Empty destinations correctly rejected on both POST and PATCH. Missing destinations field also rejected. Frontend disables submit button with 0 chips — double-enforcement.
- **Sprint 17 regression:** Print button unaffected by Sprint 19 changes. Full test suite at 416/416 frontend + 287/287 backend — zero regressions.
- **Sprint 19 breaks the planning-without-execution pattern** from Sprints 17/18 — all 10 tasks executed and delivered.

### Recommended Sprint 20 Actions

1. **Minor fix (FB-009):** Add `.items(Joi.string().max(100))` to destinations array schema in backend trip validation — 5-minute fix, closes the POST/PATCH length validation gap.
2. **Minor fix (FB-008):** Add custom Joi `.messages()` on PATCH destination validation to match POST error message — consistency fix.
3. Both items are low priority; neither blocks any current user flow.

**[2026-03-09] Monitor Agent → User Agent**
Sprint #19 post-deploy health check complete.
**Status:** Ready for Testing
**Environment:** Staging
All health checks passed. Config consistency validated. Staging environment is ready for user acceptance testing.

**Sprint #19 features available for testing:**
- T-178: Auth rate limiting — login endpoint rate-limited at 10 requests/15min (`RateLimit-Limit: 10` header confirmed), register at 5/60min. Returns 429 `RATE_LIMITED` when exceeded.
- T-180: Multi-destination chip UI — trips can be created and edited with multiple destinations (array). Verified: POST /trips with `["Tokyo","Kyoto","Osaka"]` returns 201 with correct destinations array. PATCH /trips/:id destinations update returns 200.

**Health check evidence:**
- `GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health` → 200 `{"status":"ok"}`
- `POST https://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/register` → 201 (new user created)
- `POST https://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login` → 200 (valid creds), 401 (invalid creds)
- `RateLimit-Limit: 10`, `RateLimit-Remaining: 6` headers present on login endpoint
- `POST https://localhost:3001/api/v1/trips` with 3 destinations → 200, array persisted
- `PATCH https://localhost:3001/api/v1/trips/:id` destinations update → 200
- All unauthenticated protected route calls → 401 (not 5xx)
- `GET https://localhost:4173/` → 200 (frontend serving)
- pm2 processes: triplanner-backend (PID 2525, online), triplanner-frontend (PID 2564, online)

**User Agent (T-185) actions:**
1. Test multi-destination trip creation flow in the UI (add 3+ destinations via chip input, create trip)
2. Test destination editing in TripDetailsPage (add/remove destination chips, save)
3. Verify TripCard shows destination chips with "+N more" truncation for long lists
4. Optionally: test auth rate limiting by attempting >10 logins in 15 minutes and verifying error message in UI

6. Log results in qa-build-log.md and handoff to User Agent (T-185)

Note: Use `curl -sk` to skip TLS verification for self-signed certs.

**[Manager Agent → QA Engineer] Sprint #19 — T-180 Code Review APPROVED: Unblocks T-182**
Date: 2026-03-09
Status: T-180 → Integration Check. T-182 (QA integration testing) is now unblocked.

## T-180 Code Review — APPROVED

Manager Agent has completed review of T-180 (Frontend: multi-destination structured UI + test fixes).

**Verdict: APPROVED → Integration Check**

**What was reviewed:**
- `frontend/src/components/DestinationChipInput.jsx` — chip/tag input component
- `frontend/src/components/CreateTripModal.jsx` — uses DestinationChipInput
- `frontend/src/components/TripCard.jsx` — destinations display with formatDestinations()
- `frontend/src/pages/TripDetailsPage.jsx` — read-only chips + edit mode
- `frontend/src/__tests__/DestinationChipInput.test.jsx` — 13 tests, all pass
- `frontend/src/__tests__/CreateTripModal.test.jsx` — updated for new selectors
- `frontend/src/__tests__/TripDetailsPage.test.jsx` — destination chip/edit coverage

**Security checks PASSED:**
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — chip values render as React text nodes ✅
- No XSS vector ✅
- No hardcoded secrets ✅
- No SQL injection vectors (frontend-only) ✅
- `aria-label="Remove ${dest}"` on × buttons — Spec 18.6 compliant ✅

**Test status:** 416/416 frontend tests pass ✅

**What QA must now do:**
1. Re-run T-182 integration testing (previously blocked by T-180 test failures):
   - Multi-destination create: open modal → add 3 destinations → submit → verify trip created
   - Multi-destination edit: open trip details → edit destinations → save → verify PATCH called
   - TripCard destinations display
   - Sprint 17 regression (print button, opacity fix)
2. Update T-182 status in dev-cycle-tracker.md (Blocked → Done if all pass)
3. Log T-182 → T-183 handoff so Deploy Engineer can proceed

**[Frontend Engineer → QA Engineer] Sprint #19 — T-180 Complete: Multi-Destination UI + Test Fixes**
Date: 2026-03-09
Status: Ready for QA (T-181/T-182)

## T-180 — Multi-Destination UI: API Contract Acknowledged + Implementation Complete

**API Contract Acknowledged:**
- `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` — Sprint 1 contract, unchanged. Used to save updated destinations array.
- `POST /api/v1/trips` — Sprint 1 contract, unchanged. Accepts `{ destinations: string[] }`.
- Sprint 19 additions: `POST /auth/login` (429 RATE_LIMITED after 10/15min) and `POST /auth/register` (429 RATE_LIMITED after 5/60min) — frontend updated to handle 429 via rateLimitUtils (pre-existing). No new frontend changes required for T-178 contract.

**What was done (T-180):**
- `DestinationChipInput.jsx` — reusable chip/tag input component per Spec 18.2. Already implemented.
- `CreateTripModal.jsx` — uses DestinationChipInput for DESTINATIONS field. Submit disabled when name empty or destinations empty. Already implemented.
- `TripCard.jsx` — displays destinations via `formatDestinations()` (truncates at 3, "+N more"). Already implemented.
- `TripDetailsPage.jsx` — read-only destination chips in header + inline "edit destinations" panel using DestinationChipInput. Save calls `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id`. Already implemented.

**Test fixes applied (10 failures → 0 failures):**
1. `DestinationChipInput.test.jsx` (6 tests) — updated `getByLabelText(/add destination/i)` → `getByLabelText(/new destination/i)` to match the renamed input `aria-label="New destination"` (the "+" button carries `aria-label="Add destination"` per Spec 18.2).
2. `CreateTripModal.test.jsx` (3 tests) — updated validation error tests to use `fireEvent.submit(form)` (since submit button is correctly `disabled` when form is empty per Spec 18.3.4); updated chip input selector to `/new destination/i`.
3. `HomePage.test.jsx` (1 test) — updated chip input selector to `/new destination/i`.

**Test result:** 416/416 frontend tests pass. `npm run build` succeeds (0 errors).

**What QA should test (T-181 security + T-182 integration):**
- Create modal: chip input adds destinations on Enter/comma; × removes; submit disabled with 0 chips; submit sends string array to POST /api/v1/trips.
- TripCard: destinations display truncated (up to 3 + "+N more").
- TripDetailsPage: destination chips in header; "edit destinations" button opens inline chip editor; save calls PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id with updated array; cancel discards changes.
- Accessibility: each × button has `aria-label="Remove [destination]"`.
- XSS: chip values rendered as React text nodes (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML).

**Known limitations:** None. All Spec 18 states (empty, loading, error, success) implemented.

**[Deploy Engineer → Frontend Engineer] Sprint #19 — T-183 Blocked: Fix 10 Frontend Test Failures**
Date: 2026-03-09
Status: Blocked — Awaiting Frontend Engineer Fix

## T-183 Deploy — BLOCKED on Frontend Test Failures

Deploy Engineer has been invoked for T-183 (Sprint 19 staging re-deployment). The deploy **cannot proceed** because T-182 (QA integration testing) has not passed. QA found 10 frontend test failures that must be resolved before the pipeline can continue.

### What needs to be fixed

**File:** `frontend/src/components/DestinationChipInput.jsx`

**The conflict:** Sprint 19 renamed the input `aria-label` from `"Add destination"` to `"New destination"` and added a new `<button aria-label="Add destination">`. Tests using `getByLabelText(/add destination/i)` now match the *button* instead of the *input*, breaking 6 tests. Additionally, the `CreateTripModal.jsx` submit button is now disabled when the form is empty, breaking 3 validation error tests.

**Recommended fix (one line):** In `DestinationChipInput.jsx` at the `+` button (line ~153), change:
```
aria-label="Add destination"
```
to:
```
aria-label="Add destination chip"
```

This unblocks all 6 `DestinationChipInput.test.jsx` failures with no test changes needed. Then update the 3+1 `CreateTripModal.test.jsx` / `HomePage.test.jsx` tests to supply a valid `destinations` array before clicking submit (since the button is now correctly disabled when empty).

**Target:** `npm test --run` in `frontend/` → **416/416 PASS** (all 10 currently failing tests must pass)

### Current test counts
- Backend: ✅ 287/287 pass (no action needed)
- Frontend: ❌ 406/416 pass (10 fail — need 416/416)

### After fix: QA must re-certify T-182

Once the 10 test failures are fixed:
1. QA Engineer re-runs `npm test --run` in `frontend/` → confirms 416/416 PASS
2. QA logs updated T-182 result in `qa-build-log.md` and logs a T-182 → T-183 handoff in this file
3. Deploy Engineer (T-183) proceeds immediately

### Infrastructure is ready — no other blockers

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| pm2 `triplanner-backend` (PID 51577) | ✅ Online |
| pm2 `triplanner-frontend` (PID 51694) | ✅ Online |
| Backend tests (T-178 rate limiter) | ✅ 287/287 pass |
| Frontend build (`npm run build`) | ✅ 0 errors, 122 modules |
| T-181 security checklist | ✅ PASS |
| No migrations needed | ✅ T-178 is middleware only |

**[QA → Frontend Engineer] Sprint #19 — QA Blocked**
Date: 2026-03-09
Status: Blocked
Issues:
1. **DestinationChipInput aria-label conflict (6 test failures):** Sprint 19 renamed the text input `aria-label` from `"Add destination"` to `"New destination"` and added a new `<button aria-label="Add destination">`. All existing tests using `getByLabelText(/add destination/i)` now find the button instead of the input. Affected: `DestinationChipInput.test.jsx` tests: "calls onChange when Enter is pressed", "calls onChange when comma is pressed", "removes last destination on Backspace", "clears input on Escape key", "input has aria-describedby pointing to dest-chip-hint", "input has aria-describedby pointing to dest-chip-error".
2. **CreateTripModal submit disabled state (3 test failures):** Sprint 19 changed the submit button to `disabled={isLoading || !name.trim() || destinations.length === 0}`. Tests that click submit with empty form to trigger validation errors now fail because the button is disabled. Affected: `CreateTripModal.test.jsx` tests: "shows validation error when trip name is empty on submit", "shows validation error when destinations is empty on submit", "calls onSubmit with form data when valid (chip input)".
3. **HomePage cascade failure (1 test failure):** `HomePage.test.jsx` "navigates to new trip page after successful creation" fails because `getByLabelText(/add destination/i)` matches the button (same root cause as #1), so no destinations are added and submit remains disabled.

**Required fix:** Update `DestinationChipInput.jsx` button aria-label to something non-conflicting (e.g., `"Add destination chip"` or `"Confirm destination"`), OR update the test selectors to `getByLabelText(/new destination/i)` for the input. Also update validation error tests to use a different approach (e.g., check that the submit button is disabled rather than clicking it and looking for an error message).

See qa-build-log.md Sprint #19 QA Run section for full details.

**From:** Manager Agent (Code Review)
**To:** QA Engineer
**Sprint:** #19
**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Status:** T-178 APPROVED — cleared for Integration Check (T-181)

## T-178 — Auth Rate Limiting: Manager Code Review APPROVED

T-178 passed Manager code review. T-181 (QA: Security checklist + code review for Sprint 19) may proceed as soon as T-180 is also complete.

### Review Verdict: APPROVED ✅

All acceptance criteria (A–E) verified by code inspection:

| Criterion | Check | Result |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `loginLimiter`: 10/15min per IP | Verified in `rateLimiter.js` line 48–54 | ✅ |
| `registerLimiter`: 5/60min per IP | Verified in `rateLimiter.js` line 62–68 | ✅ |
| `standardHeaders: true`, `legacyHeaders: false` | Verified on both limiters | ✅ |
| 429 body: `{ error: { code: "RATE_LIMITED", message: "..." } }` | Matches global API error contract | ✅ |
| Limiters applied before route handler in `auth.js` | Lines 71 (`registerLimiter`) and 150 (`loginLimiter`) | ✅ |
| No hardcoded secrets | None found | ✅ |
| 429 response contains no stack trace or internal detail | Verified in handler + test D2 | ✅ |
| IP-based keying (not user-supplied input) | Default `express-rate-limit` behavior | ✅ |
| Tests: happy-path (A/C) + error-path (B/D) + isolation (E) | 9 tests in `sprint19.test.js` | ✅ |

### Approved Scope Deviation (non-blocking)
`generalAuthLimiter` (30/15min) is applied to `/refresh` and `/logout` — not explicitly in T-178 spec. Confirmed via handoff-log that this is a refactor of **pre-existing inline rate limiters** that already existed on these routes. Limit (30/15min) is permissive and will not affect legitimate users. Approved.

### For QA (T-181) — Areas to Focus
1. **Security checklist:** Verify no stack traces leak from 429 responses in staging environment
2. **Integration test (T-182):** Actually fire 11 POST /auth/login requests against staging to verify the wiring (test suite used isolated test apps for the 429 shape; staging integration closes that gap)
3. **Register integration:** Fire 6 POST /auth/register requests to confirm 429 on the 6th
4. **Non-auth isolation:** Confirm GET /api/v1/trips still returns 200/401 under repeated requests (not 429)
5. Note the `generalAuthLimiter` on `/refresh`+`/logout` — include in security review, verify it doesn't break token refresh flows

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Sprint:** #19
**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Status:** Ready for QA — T-178 (Auth Rate Limiting) implementation complete

## T-178 — Auth Rate Limiting: QA Handoff

T-178 implementation is complete. All 287 backend tests pass. Ready for security checklist audit and integration testing.

### What was implemented

**New file:** `backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.js`
- `loginLimiter`: 10 requests per 15-minute window per IP → 429 `RATE_LIMITED`
- `registerLimiter`: 5 requests per 60-minute window per IP → 429 `RATE_LIMITED`
- `generalAuthLimiter`: 30 requests per 15-minute window per IP → 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (for /refresh, /logout)
- All use `standardHeaders: true`, `legacyHeaders: false`

**Modified:** `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
- Removed inline rate limiters; now imports from `rateLimiter.js`
- Error code changed: `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` → `RATE_LIMITED` (to match T-178 contract)
- Register limit updated: 20/15min → 5/60min (as specified)
- Login limit unchanged: 10/15min

**New tests:** `backend/src/__tests__/sprint19.test.js` (9 tests)
- Test A: Login within limit → 200 ✅
- Test B: Login over limit → 429 RATE_LIMITED + correct message ✅
- Test C: Register within limit → 201 ✅
- Test D: Register over limit → 429 RATE_LIMITED + register-specific message ✅
- Test E: Health endpoint not rate limited ✅
- Extra: RateLimit-* standard headers present, X-RateLimit-* legacy headers absent ✅
- Extra: 429 body does NOT expose stack traces or internal details ✅

### What QA should verify (T-181 Security Checklist)

1. **Rate limiter uses IP-based keying** — express-rate-limit default; NOT user-supplied input
2. **429 response shape** — `{ "error": { "code": "RATE_LIMITED", "message": "..." } }` — no stack trace
3. **Login limit**: 10 attempts per 15 min per IP; attempt 11 → 429
4. **Register limit**: 5 attempts per 60 min per IP; attempt 6 → 429
5. **Non-auth endpoints unaffected** — `GET /api/v1/health`, trip routes, etc. return 200 normally
6. **Standard headers only** — `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset` present; `X-RateLimit-*` absent
7. **All 287 backend tests pass**: `cd backend && npm test`

### What QA should test (T-182 Integration Testing)

1. POST 11 rapid login attempts with wrong password:
   - Attempts 1–10: 401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS (within limit)
   - Attempt 11: 429 RATE_LIMITED "Too many login attempts, please try again later."
2. POST 6 rapid register attempts:
   - Attempts 1–5: 201/409/400 (within limit)
   - Attempt 6: 429 RATE_LIMITED "Too many registration attempts, please try again later."
3. GET /api/v1/health many times — always 200 (not rate limited)
4. Sprint 17 regression: Print button still visible; "No dates yet" legible
5. Sprint 16 regression: Trip date ranges on home page correct

### No deploy engineer action needed for migrations
No schema changes. No new migrations. The only deploy action is `pm2 restart triplanner-backend` to pick up the new `rateLimiter.js` module (T-183).

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** All Agents
**Sprint:** #19
**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Status:** Sprint 19 Kickoff

## Sprint 19 Kickoff — Priorities and Assignments

Sprint 18 was fully planned but never executed. All 10 tasks (T-176–T-185) carry forward to Sprint 19 unchanged. The Sprint 17 staging deployment (T-175) is still live on HTTPS staging. Sprint 19 must execute all phases to completion — no more planning-only sprints.

**⚠️ Critical escalation — B-020 (Auth Rate Limiting): 18 consecutive sprints deferred. This is now a P0 — auth endpoints have been unprotected since Sprint 1. T-178 ships this sprint, no exceptions.**

**⚠️ Critical escalation — B-022 (Production Deployment): 19 consecutive sprints without a hosting provider decision. Project owner: please review `.workflow/hosting-research.md` and select a provider. All infrastructure is production-ready.**

**To:** All Agents
**Sprint:** #18
**Date:** 2026-03-08
**Status:** Sprint 18 Kickoff (superseded — Sprint 18 did not execute; see Sprint 19 Kickoff above)

## Sprint 18 Kickoff — Priorities and Assignments

Sprint 17 closed with T-176 (Monitor) and T-177 (User Agent) not reached. Sprint 17 staging build (T-175) is live on HTTPS staging. Sprint 18 immediately starts with those carry-overs, then adds auth rate limiting (B-020) and multi-destination UI spec (B-007).

---

### For Monitor Agent — T-176 (HIGHEST PRIORITY — start immediately)

Sprint 17 staging is live. T-175 built and deployed the frontend. Your job is to verify it.

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Sprint:** #20
**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Status:** Ready

## Sprint 20 API Contracts Ready — Frontend Engineer (T-189)

The Sprint 20 API contracts are published in `.workflow/api-contracts.md` (Sprint 20 section, 2026-03-10). You may proceed with T-189 (TripNotesSection component).

### Relevant contracts for T-189

**PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id — notes field**
- Send `{ notes: string | null }` in the request body
- `notes` max 2000 characters
- Empty string `""` is normalized to `null` server-side — you can safely send `null` directly (the component spec trims and converts empty to `null`: `editNotes.trim() || null`)
- Success response `200 OK` includes `notes: string | null` in the trip data object

**GET /api/v1/trips/:id — notes field in response**
- `data.notes` is `string | null` — `null` when no notes have been set
- Use `trip.notes` to populate the TripNotesSection initial state

**Validation boundary:**
- Backend enforces max 2000 chars — the `<textarea maxLength={2000}>` in the frontend prevents exceeding this in normal use, but the backend will reject oversized inputs with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` if the limit is bypassed

### Key fields in trip response shape (Sprint 20 confirmed)
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "string",
    "destinations": ["string"],
    "status": "PLANNING | ONGOING | COMPLETED",
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD | null",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD | null",
    "notes": "string | null",
    "created_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
    "updated_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp"
  }
}
```

### No new endpoints
T-189 uses only the existing `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` and `GET /api/v1/trips/:id` endpoints. No new endpoints are introduced.

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Sprint:** #20
**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Status:** Ready for QA planning

## Sprint 20 API Contracts — QA Reference (T-190, T-191)

Sprint 20 backend contracts are published in `.workflow/api-contracts.md` (Sprint 20 section, 2026-03-10). Use this as the reference for your security checklist and integration tests.

### T-186 — Destination Validation (QA checklist)

**What changed:** Joi validation on `destinations` array items now enforces a 100-char max. PATCH empty-destinations error message is standardized.

| Test Case | Endpoint | Input | Expected |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| A | POST /api/v1/trips | destinations: ["X" × 101] | 400 VALIDATION_ERROR |
| B | PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id | destinations: ["X" × 101] | 400 VALIDATION_ERROR |
| C | PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id | destinations: [] | 400, message = "At least one destination is required" |
| D | POST /api/v1/trips | destinations: ["X" × 100] | 201 Created |
| E | PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id | destinations: ["X" × 100] | 200 OK |

**Security note for T-190:** Joi `.max(100)` prevents oversized destination strings from reaching the database. The standardized error message does not leak schema internals — it is a human-readable string.

### T-188 — Trip Notes Field (QA checklist)

**What changed:** Formal max-2000 Joi validation added to POST and PATCH. `notes` field confirmed present in all trip response shapes.

| Test Case | Endpoint | Input | Expected |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| A | POST /api/v1/trips | notes: "Hello world" | 201, notes: "Hello world" in response |
| B | PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id | notes: "Updated" | 200, notes: "Updated" in response |
| C | PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id | notes: null | 200, notes: null in response |
| D | PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id | notes: "" | 200, notes: null in response (normalized) |
| E | GET /api/v1/trips/:id | — | 200, notes field present in data |
| F | GET /api/v1/trips | — | 200, notes field present on each trip in list |
| G | POST /api/v1/trips | notes omitted | 201, notes: null in response |
| H | POST /api/v1/trips | notes: "x" × 2001 | 400 VALIDATION_ERROR |
| I | PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id | notes: "x" × 2001 | 400 VALIDATION_ERROR |

**Security note for T-190:**
- `notes` is stored via parameterized Knex query — no SQL injection risk
- Max 2000 enforced at the API layer — prevents oversized payloads from reaching the database
- The `notes` value is returned as plain text and rendered in the frontend as a React text node (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) — XSS safe

### Schema note
No new migration for Sprint 20. The `notes TEXT NULL` column on `trips` was applied in Sprint 7 (migration 010). The Deploy Engineer does NOT need to run a new migration for T-188. Confirm migration 010 is applied during T-192 smoke tests.

### Backend test target
287+ base (Sprint 19 target) + 5 T-186 cases + 9 T-188 cases = **301+ total backend tests**

---

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Sprint:** #20
**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Status:** Ready for QA

## Sprint 20 Implementation Complete — T-186 + T-188

Both backend tasks are in **In Review** status. All 304 backend tests pass.

### T-186 — Destination Validation Tightening (Bug Fix)

**What was changed:**

1. **`backend/src/middleware/validate.js`** — Added `itemMaxLength` and `itemMinLength` options for array field validation. When set, each string item in the array is checked against the limit. The first offending item triggers a `fields.<field>` error. Message can be overridden via `rules.messages.itemMaxLength`.

2. **`backend/src/routes/trips.js`** — Updated `destinations` schema in both POST and PATCH handlers:
   - POST: added `itemMaxLength: 100` + override message `'Each destination must be at most 100 characters'`
   - PATCH: added `itemMaxLength: 100` + override message, plus `messages.minItems: 'At least one destination is required'` (fixes FB-008 — previously returned raw `destinations must have at least 1 item(s)`)

3. **`backend/src/__tests__/sprint20.test.js`** (new) — Tests A–E cover all T-186 acceptance criteria.

**Security check (T-190):**
- `itemMaxLength: 100` prevents destination strings > 100 chars from reaching the DB ✅
- Error messages are user-friendly strings, no internal schema details exposed ✅
- All validation is pre-query; no SQL execution path affected ✅

**Test coverage for QA to verify:**
| Case | Input | Expected |
|------|-------|---------|
| A | POST destinations: ["X" × 101] | 400 VALIDATION_ERROR, fields.destinations present |
| B | PATCH destinations: ["X" × 101] | 400 VALIDATION_ERROR, fields.destinations present |
| C | PATCH destinations: [] | 400, fields.destinations = "At least one destination is required" |
| D | POST destinations: ["X" × 100] | 201 Created |
| E | PATCH destinations: ["X" × 100] | 200 OK |

### T-188 — Trip Notes Field (Feature)

**What was verified:** All T-188 requirements were pre-implemented in Sprint 7 (T-103). No new code changes needed. Sprint 20 adds explicit acceptance tests in `sprint20.test.js` (tests F–K).

**Existing implementation confirmed:**
- `backend/src/migrations/20260227_010_add_trip_notes.js` — `notes TEXT NULL` column, with up/down ✅
- `backend/src/models/tripModel.js` — `notes` in TRIP_COLUMNS (SELECT); `createTrip` / `updateTrip` handle `notes` field ✅
- `backend/src/routes/trips.js` — POST + PATCH schemas include `notes: max(2000), nullable, optional`; GET returns notes via model ✅
- `backend/src/__tests__/sprint7.test.js` — 9 existing T-103 notes tests ✅
- `backend/src/__tests__/sprint20.test.js` — 6 additional T-188 acceptance tests (F–K) ✅

**Security check (T-190):**
- `notes` stored via parameterized Knex query (`db('trips').insert(data)`) — no SQL injection vector ✅
- Max 2000 chars enforced at API layer before any DB interaction ✅
- `notes` value is never executed as code ✅

**Deploy note:** No new migration for T-188. Migration 010 (`notes TEXT NULL`) was applied in Sprint 7. Deploy Engineer should confirm it's present (`SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'trips' AND column_name = 'notes'`).

---

### Test counts
- **Baseline (Sprint 19):** 287 tests
- **Sprint 20 additions:** 17 new tests in `sprint20.test.js`
- **Total:** **304 tests — all passing** (`npm test --run` verified 2026-03-10)

**Next step:** QA Engineer can begin T-190 (security checklist) once Frontend Engineer completes T-189.

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → Monitor Agent**

**Sprint 20 code review phase COMPLETE — T-193 (Monitor health check) is UNBLOCKED and IN PROGRESS.**

### Code Review Summary (Manager Agent)

All Sprint 20 engineering tasks have been reviewed and approved. No tasks are in "In Review" status:

| Task | Engineer | Review Result | Current Status |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| T-186 | Backend Engineer | ✅ APPROVED | Done |
| T-187 | Design Agent | ✅ APPROVED (auto) | Done |
| T-188 | Backend Engineer | ✅ APPROVED | Done |
| T-189 | Frontend Engineer | ✅ APPROVED | Done |

QA (T-190 + T-191), Deploy (T-192) all Done. Sprint 20 is at the final validation phase.

### Monitor Agent Assignment: T-193

**Your task:** Sprint 20 staging health check — full spec in `dev-cycle-tracker.md` Phase 5.

**Checklist to verify:**
1. HTTPS handshake on both services ✅
2. pm2 `triplanner-backend` online port 3001, `triplanner-frontend` online ✅
3. `GET /api/v1/health` → 200 `{"status":"ok"}` ✅
4. Sprint 20 — notes field: GET /api/v1/trips/:id includes `notes` key (null or string) ✅
5. Sprint 20 — destination validation: POST with 101-char destination → 400 ✅
6. Sprint 19 regression: `RateLimit-Limit: 10` header on POST /auth/login ✅
7. Sprint 17 regression: "Print itinerary" button visible on TripDetailsPage ✅
8. Sprint 16 regression: GET /trips → trips include `start_date`/`end_date` ✅
9. `npx playwright test` → 7/7 PASS ✅

**On pass:** Write full report to `qa-build-log.md` Sprint 20 Monitor section. Log handoff to User Agent (T-194) in `handoff-log.md`. Mark T-193 Done in `dev-cycle-tracker.md`.

**On fail:** Log specific failures in `qa-build-log.md` and `handoff-log.md`. Mark T-193 Blocked. Escalate to Manager if structural issue found.


---

**[2026-03-10] Design Agent → Manager Agent** *(Spec 20 Published — Manager Approval Required)*

**Task:** T-195 — Spec 20: Trip Status Selector
**Status:** Awaiting Manager Approval → T-196 Unblock

Spec 20 has been published to `.workflow/ui-spec.md` under **Sprint 22 Specs → Spec 20: Trip Status Selector**.

### What Spec 20 Covers

- **Location:** TripDetailsPage trip header — inline with trip name (flex row, right side), or wrapping below on narrow viewports
- **View mode:** Clickable status badge/pill matching existing TripCard badge styling (PLANNING / ONGOING / COMPLETED with Japandi muted palette colors)
- **Dropdown:** Custom listbox with colored indicator dots, checkmark on selected option, and standard Japandi surface (`#30292F`) background
- **Optimistic update:** Badge immediately shows new status on selection; reverted on API error
- **Loading state:** Chevron replaced by 12px CSS spinner; badge at 0.7 opacity; `pointer-events: none`; `aria-busy="true"`
- **Error state:** Reverts to previous status; generic bottom-right toast (4s auto-dismiss); no API error details leaked to UI
- **Accessibility:** Full ARIA listbox pattern (`aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, `aria-selected`). Keyboard navigation: Space/Enter to open, ArrowUp/ArrowDown to navigate, Enter/Space to select, Escape to close
- **TripCard sync:** Standard re-fetch on Home page navigation — no real-time sync needed
- **Edge cases:** Same-status no-op, in-flight click prevention, unexpected status fallback, `initialStatus` prop sync via `useEffect`

### What the Manager Must Do

1. Review Spec 20 in `.workflow/ui-spec.md`
2. Confirm "Approved" (or request revisions)
3. Log approval handoff to the Frontend Engineer so T-196 can begin

### Downstream Dependency

- **T-196 (Frontend Engineer)** is blocked by this spec being approved
- No backend changes are required — `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` already accepts the `status` field per Sprint 1 API contract

---

**[2026-03-10] Design Agent → Frontend Engineer** *(Spec 20 Approved — T-196 Unblocked)*

**Task:** T-196 — Frontend: TripStatusSelector component
**Spec Reference:** Spec 20 in `.workflow/ui-spec.md` (Sprint 22 Specs section)
**Status:** T-195 Done → T-196 Unblocked (pending Manager triage of T-194 feedback per sprint dependency chain)

Spec 20 has been published and auto-approved. The Frontend Engineer may begin T-196 once the Manager confirms T-194 feedback is clean (per the sprint dependency chain — see `active-sprint.md` Phase 2 gate).

### Key Implementation Notes from Spec 20

1. **Component:** `frontend/src/components/TripStatusSelector.jsx`
   - Props: `tripId` (string), `initialStatus` (enum string), `onStatusChange` (callback)
   - Internal state: `currentStatus`, `isOpen`, `isLoading`, `error`

2. **Optimistic update pattern:** Set `currentStatus` to new value immediately on selection, then fire PATCH. On error, revert `currentStatus` to previous value and show toast.

3. **Same-status no-op:** If user selects the currently active status, close dropdown without API call.

4. **ARIA listbox pattern:** See §20.10 accessibility checklist. Use `role="listbox"` on the dropdown `ul`, `role="option"` on each `li`, `aria-selected` on each option, `aria-haspopup="listbox"` + `aria-expanded` on the badge button.

5. **Outside-click close:** `mousedown` listener on `document` while dropdown is open; check `ref.contains(event.target)` to distinguish inside vs. outside clicks.

6. **Focus management:** On Escape or outside-click: return focus to badge button. On option select: focus remains on badge button after dropdown closes.

7. **Integration into TripDetailsPage:** Flex row in trip header. See §20.12 for exact JSX pattern and `handleStatusChange` callback pattern.

8. **Tests (T-196):** See `dev-cycle-tracker.md` T-196 test plan (A–G). The "same status no-op" scenario should also be tested.

Full spec with visual mockups in `.workflow/ui-spec.md` — Spec 20.

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint 22 API Contracts Ready — T-196)*

**Task:** T-196 — Frontend: TripStatusSelector component
**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** ✅ API Contracts Published — T-196 may proceed (pending Phase 2 gate: T-194 feedback triage by Manager)

### API Contract Summary for T-196

The `TripStatusSelector` component (T-196) requires **no new backend endpoints**. It operates entirely against the existing, already-deployed `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` endpoint.

**Endpoint to call:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Method | `PATCH` |
| Path | `/api/v1/trips/:id` |
| Auth | `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` |
| Content-Type | `application/json` |

**Request body (status change):**
```json
{ "status": "ONGOING" }
```

**Valid `status` values:** `"PLANNING"` · `"ONGOING"` · `"COMPLETED"` — no other value is accepted.

**Success response — 200 OK:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "string",
    "destinations": ["string"],
    "status": "ONGOING",
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD | null",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD | null",
    "notes": "string | null",
    "created_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
    "updated_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp"
  }
}
```

**Error responses:**

| HTTP | Code | When |
|------|------|------|
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `status` value is not one of the three valid enum values |
| 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Missing or expired Bearer token |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | Trip belongs to a different user |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Trip ID does not exist |
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Server-side failure |

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Optimistic update:** Update `currentStatus` in state immediately on selection. Fire PATCH. On non-200 response, revert to previous status and show generic error toast — do NOT expose error details from the API response to the UI.
2. **Same-status no-op:** If the user selects the status already shown, close the dropdown without calling the API.
3. **Client-side validation:** Always send one of the three hardcoded enum strings. No raw user input reaches the API.
4. **Token refresh:** If a 401 is returned, follow the standard token refresh flow already in place in the app.

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint 22 API Contracts Ready — T-197, T-198)*

**Task:** T-197, T-198 — QA: Security checklist + Integration testing
**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ API Contracts Published — use this as the reference for integration test cases

### QA Reference: What Changed in Sprint 22 (Backend)

**Nothing changed in the backend.** Sprint 22 is a frontend-only feature sprint. The `status` field on `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` has existed and been tested since Sprint 1. The test baseline remains **304/304 backend tests** — no new backend tests are expected.

### Endpoint Under Test for T-198 (Integration Testing)

**`PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` — status update path**

| Case | Input | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| A | `{ "status": "ONGOING" }` (authenticated, own trip) | 200, response `"status": "ONGOING"` |
| B | `{ "status": "COMPLETED" }` (authenticated, own trip) | 200, response `"status": "COMPLETED"` |
| C | `{ "status": "PLANNING" }` (authenticated, own trip) | 200, response `"status": "PLANNING"` |
| D | `{ "status": "INVALID" }` (direct API call) | 400, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `fields.status` present |
| E | `{ "status": "ONGOING" }` (no auth token) | 401, `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| F | `{ "status": "ONGOING" }` (another user's trip) | 403, `FORBIDDEN` |
| G | `{ "status": "ONGOING" }` (non-existent trip ID) | 404, `NOT_FOUND` |

### Security Checklist Notes (T-197 — Backend Scope)

- ✅ **No new endpoints:** Attack surface is unchanged from Sprint 20.
- ✅ **Status validation is enum-only:** `status` must be one of three literal strings. No string injection vector.
- ✅ **Auth middleware unchanged:** Bearer token required on all trip mutation endpoints. No bypass paths added.
- ✅ **No new migrations:** Schema surface is identical to Sprint 20 staging.
- ✅ **No secrets or environment changes:** No new environment variables added.
- ✅ **Rate limiting still in force:** `/auth/login` rate limiting from Sprint 19 is unchanged.

**[2026-03-10] Deploy Engineer → Manager Agent / Frontend Engineer / QA Engineer** *(T-199 — BLOCKED: Pre-Deploy Gate Not Met)*

**Task:** T-199 — Deploy Engineer: Sprint 22 staging re-deployment
**Status:** ⛔ BLOCKED — Pre-deploy gate not satisfied
**Date:** 2026-03-10

## T-199 Deploy — BLOCKED: Dependency Chain Incomplete

Deploy Engineer has been invoked for T-199 (Sprint 22 staging re-deployment). The deploy **cannot proceed** because the mandatory pre-deploy gate has not been met.

### Pre-Deploy Gate Requirement

Per T-199 specification: **"Pre-deploy gate: T-198 Done."**

The following upstream tasks are NOT yet complete:

| Task | Assigned To | Status | Blocker |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| T-196 | Frontend Engineer | Backlog | `TripStatusSelector.jsx` not created |
| T-197 | QA Engineer | Backlog | Blocked by T-196 |
| T-198 | QA Engineer | Backlog | Blocked by T-197 |
| T-199 | Deploy Engineer | **BLOCKED** | Blocked by T-198 (pre-deploy gate) |

### Evidence

1. **T-196 not done:** `frontend/src/components/TripStatusSelector.jsx` does not exist. Only `StatusBadge.jsx` is present — no interactive selector component.
2. **T-197/T-198 not done:** No Sprint 22 QA entries found in `qa-build-log.md`. No QA → Deploy handoff in `handoff-log.md` for Sprint 22.
3. **Last git checkpoint:** `sprint #22 -- phase 'contracts' complete` — build and QA phases have not run.

### What Needs to Happen Before T-199 Can Proceed

1. **Frontend Engineer** must complete T-196 — implement `frontend/src/components/TripStatusSelector.jsx` per Spec 20 with all 7 tests (A–G) passing. All 429+ existing frontend tests must continue to pass.
2. **QA Engineer** must complete T-197 — run security checklist, backend tests (304+), frontend tests (436+), npm audit. Log report in `qa-build-log.md` Sprint 22 section.
3. **QA Engineer** must complete T-198 — run integration testing for all Sprint 22 scenarios plus regressions. Log report in `qa-build-log.md`. Log QA → Deploy handoff in `handoff-log.md`.
4. **Deploy Engineer (T-199)** will proceed immediately upon receiving the QA → Deploy handoff in `handoff-log.md`.

### Infrastructure Status (Ready — No Blockers on Deploy Side)

- ✅ pm2 `triplanner-backend` online (port 3001, 8h uptime)
- ✅ pm2 `triplanner-frontend` online (7h uptime)
- ✅ `GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health` → `{"status":"ok"}` confirmed
- ✅ No new migrations required (status column exists since Sprint 1, migration 003)
- ✅ Backend already serving `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with full `status` field support
- ✅ All staging infrastructure from Sprint 20 deploy (T-192) remains intact

**The deployment environment is fully ready. The only blocker is missing QA confirmation (T-197 + T-198).**

### Action Required

- **Frontend Engineer:** Complete T-196 (TripStatusSelector.jsx) immediately — it is the critical path blocker for the entire Phase 4 pipeline.
- **QA Engineer:** Run T-197 + T-198 after T-196 is done. Log handoff to Deploy Engineer when complete.
- **Manager Agent:** T-199 is blocked. The Sprint 22 pipeline is stalled at Phase 2/3 (Build/QA). T-196 must execute next.

---

**[2026-03-10] Frontend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #22 — T-196 Complete → T-197 + T-198 Handoff)*

**Task completed:** T-196 — TripStatusSelector component (Sprint 22, Spec 20)
**T-196 status:** ✅ In Review
**Unblocks:** T-197 (security checklist + code review) + T-198 (integration tests)

---

### What Was Built

**New files:**
- `frontend/src/components/TripStatusSelector.jsx` — interactive inline status badge component
- `frontend/src/components/TripStatusSelector.module.css` — colocated styles
- `frontend/src/__tests__/TripStatusSelector.test.jsx` — 22 tests

**Modified files:**
- `frontend/src/pages/TripDetailsPage.jsx` — imports TripStatusSelector, adds `localTripStatus` state + `handleStatusChange`, wraps `<h1>` + `<TripStatusSelector>` in `tripNameGroup` flex div
- `frontend/src/pages/TripDetailsPage.module.css` — adds `.tripNameGroup { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px; flex-wrap: wrap }` rule

---

### All Spec 20 States Implemented

| State | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| **A — View mode** | Badge pill: status color bg + text, indicator dot (currentColor), chevron ▾. `cursor: pointer`. Hover: `filter: brightness(1.15)`. `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded="false"` |
| **B — Dropdown open** | `<ul role="listbox">` with 3 `<li role="option" aria-selected>` rows. Position: `absolute; top: calc(100% + 4px); left: 0; z-index: 100`. Indicator dots + checkmark ✓ on selected. Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down, Enter/Space selects, Escape closes |
| **C — Loading (optimistic)** | Badge immediately shows new status (optimistic). Chevron replaced by 12px CSS spinner (`border-top-color: transparent; animation: spin 0.8s linear`). `opacity: 0.7`. `pointer-events: none`. `aria-busy="true"`. `aria-label` includes "(saving…)" |
| **D — Error** | Reverts `currentStatus` to previous. Error toast rendered: `background: #30292F; border: 1px solid rgba(220,80,80,0.5)`. `role="alert"`. Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds via `setTimeout` in `useEffect`. |
| **E — Pre-load error** | Not rendered (TripStatusSelector only mounts when `trip` is loaded and `trip.status` is available) |

### Edge Cases Covered (Spec §20.14)
- Same status selected → dropdown closes, no API call, no loading state
- `pointer-events: none` during loading → double-click impossible
- Unknown `initialStatus` → renders raw string in COMPLETED (muted) style, dropdown shows valid 3 options
- `initialStatus` prop changes → re-synced via `useEffect([initialStatus])` guard (only when not loading)
- Network offline → PATCH fails → toast, revert, user can retry

---

### Test Results

```
Tests:       22 passed (22/22 new)
Full suite:  451 passed (451/451) — was 429/429 before Sprint 22
Regressions: 0
```

**Test coverage includes:**
- Badge renders for PLANNING / ONGOING / COMPLETED / unknown status
- Dropdown hidden initially; opens on click
- All 3 options visible; `aria-selected` correct; checkmark on selected
- Escape closes dropdown; no change
- Same status click → no `api.trips.update` call
- New status click → `api.trips.update(tripId, { status })` called correctly
- `onStatusChange` invoked on success; NOT invoked on failure
- Optimistic update visible before API resolves
- Error toast (`role="alert"`) on API failure; status reverted
- `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded` false/true, `aria-label` includes status name
- `initialStatus` prop change re-syncs component

---

### What QA Should Test (T-197 + T-198)

**T-197 Security Checklist:**
1. Status value is restricted to enum (`PLANNING`/`ONGOING`/`COMPLETED`) — options are hardcoded, no user-typed input sent to API ✅
2. Status text rendered as React text node (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) ✅
3. Error message is generic — no server error body surfaced to UI ✅
4. No secrets hardcoded ✅
5. Run `npm test --run` in `frontend/` → expect 451/451 ✅
6. Run `npm test --run` in `backend/` → expect 304/304 ✅
7. Run `npm audit` → flag Critical/High

**T-198 Integration Tests (suggested):**
1. Load TripDetailsPage for a PLANNING trip → status selector badge shows `[• PLANNING ▾]` ✅
2. Click badge → dropdown appears with 3 options; PLANNING has ✓ checkmark ✅
3. Select ONGOING → optimistic update shows `[• ONGOING ◌]` → API resolves → `[• ONGOING ▾]` ✅
4. Navigate to Home → TripCard shows ONGOING (re-fetch on mount) ✅
5. Click badge → select COMPLETED → success ✅
6. Simulate API failure (kill backend) → badge reverts to previous status, error toast appears 4s then dismisses ✅
7. Select same status → no network request ✅
8. Keyboard flow: Tab to badge → Space opens dropdown → ArrowDown to ONGOING → Enter selects ✅
9. Keyboard: Escape closes dropdown, focus returns to badge, no change ✅
10. Mobile viewport (< 768px): badge wraps to next line if name is long; touch target ≥ 44×28px ✅

**Known limitations / acceptable deviations:**
- Focus ring on `.badge:focus-visible` uses CSS filter brightness hover (not alpha multiply as described in spec — visually equivalent)
- `aria-label` on badge is updated synchronously (not after animation) — acceptable
- Toast uses component-local CSS (not the global `.toast` class) to apply the error-specific `rgba(220,80,80,0.5)` border per spec §20.3

**No backend changes.** `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` with `status` field works since Sprint 1 migration 003.

**Staging environment:** Backend pm2 online port 3001, frontend pm2 online port 4173 (per T-193/T-192 confirmation).

---

**[2026-03-10] Frontend Engineer → All** *(Sprint #22 — T-196 API Contract Acknowledgment)*

**Task:** T-196 — TripStatusSelector component implementation

**API Contract Acknowledged:** `PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id` — Sprint 1 contract, confirmed in api-contracts.md Sprint 22 section.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Method | `PATCH` |
| Endpoint | `/api/v1/trips/:id` |
| Request body | `{ "status": "PLANNING" \| "ONGOING" \| "COMPLETED" }` |
| Auth | Bearer token via Axios interceptor (api.trips.update wrapper) |
| Success response | `200 OK` — full trip object with updated `status` field |
| Error response | Any non-2xx — treated as generic failure, no error body parsing |

**API helper used:** `api.trips.update(tripId, { status: newStatus })` — existing Axios wrapper in `frontend/src/utils/api.js`. No new utility functions needed.

**Schema:** No backend changes required. `status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PLANNING'` on `trips` table exists since migration 003 (Sprint 1).

**Implementation starting now. No blockers.**

---

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer + Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint 22 Implementation Verification — Phase 3 Gate)*

**Task:** Sprint 22 Backend Audit (implementation standby)
**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer (T-197, T-198), Frontend Engineer (T-196 reference)
**Status:** ✅ Backend fully verified — 304/304 tests pass — no new implementation required


---

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-203 Code Review: Sent Back to In Progress)*

**Task:** T-203 — vitest dependency upgrade 1.x → 4.x (B-021 resolution)
**From:** Manager Agent (Code Review)
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** ⚠️ Sent Back to In Progress — Frontend portion incomplete

**Review Outcome:**

| Portion | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Backend (`backend/package.json`) | ✅ APPROVED | `vitest: "^4.0.18"` confirmed. 304/304 tests pass. `npm audit` = 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Frontend (`frontend/package.json`) | ❌ INCOMPLETE | Still shows `vitest: "^2.1.0"` — not upgraded to `^4.0.0`. |

**Action Required (Frontend Engineer):**

1. Upgrade `vitest` in `frontend/package.json` from `^2.1.0` to `^4.0.0`
2. Run `npm test --run` in `frontend/` — all **481** tests must pass (test count grew by +30 from T-208)
3. Run `npm audit` in `frontend/` — confirm 0 Moderate+ vulnerabilities
4. No API-breaking changes are expected (backend saw zero between vitest 2.x and 4.x for this codebase)
5. Move T-203 back to **In Review** and log completion in handoff-log.md

**Note:** T-208 has been approved and moved to Integration Check. T-204 (QA) remains blocked on BOTH T-203 and T-208 — complete T-203 promptly to unblock QA.

---

**[2026-03-10] Manager Agent → QA Engineer** *(Sprint #24 — T-208 Code Review: Approved → Integration Check)*

**Task:** T-208 — Home page trip status filter tabs (StatusFilterTabs component)
**From:** Manager Agent (Code Review)
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED — Moved to Integration Check

**Review Summary:**

| Area | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Correctness | ✅ PASS | Filter logic exactly matches Spec 21. `filteredTrips` derived correctly. `activeFilter` state initialized to `"ALL"`. |
| Empty Filtered State | ✅ PASS | Guard `filteredTrips.length === 0 && activeFilter !== "ALL" && trips.length > 0` — correctly prevents conflict with global empty state. |
| Global Empty State | ✅ PASS | Unaffected — `isEmptyDatabase` condition still checks `trips.length === 0` independent of `activeFilter`. |
| Accessibility | ✅ PASS | `role="group"`, `aria-label`, `aria-pressed`, roving tabIndex (active=0, others=-1), ArrowLeft/ArrowRight with wrapping. |
| Styling | ✅ PASS | CSS module only. Base states use CSS custom properties (`var(--border-subtle)`, `var(--text-muted)`, etc.). Hover/active rgba values match Spec 21.5 exactly. No hardcoded hex. |
| Security | ✅ PASS | No hardcoded secrets, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no auth gaps. Pure client-side derived state — no new API surface. |
| Tests | ✅ PASS | 19 unit tests (StatusFilterTabs.test.jsx) + 11 integration tests (HomePage.test.jsx). All 7 required cases A–G covered plus edge cases. 481/481 total tests pass. |
| Convention Adherence | ✅ PASS | CSS modules, controlled component pattern, useCallback for handlers, no circular deps. |

**QA Instructions:** T-208 is ready for Integration Check. Note T-203 (vitest upgrade — frontend) is still In Progress and is a blocker for T-204. QA full pass (T-204) must wait for T-203 to complete. T-208 can proceed through integration check now in parallel.

### Deploy Engineer Action Required (T-205)

Pre-deploy gate is now satisfied. Proceed with T-205 immediately:

```bash
# 1. Build frontend (picks up T-208 StatusFilterTabs + T-203 vitest bump)
cd /Users/yixinxiao/PROJECTS/triplanner/frontend
npm run build   # must exit 0

# 2. Reload frontend process
pm2 reload triplanner-frontend

# 3. Restart backend (clean state post dev-dep upgrade)
pm2 restart triplanner-backend

# 4. No migrations required (confirmed)

# 5. Smoke tests
#    GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health → 200
#    Home page status filter tabs render (All / Planning / Ongoing / Completed)
#    TripStatusSelector renders on TripDetailsPage
#    PATCH /api/v1/trips/:id { status: "ONGOING" } → 200
#    GET /api/v1/trips/:id → response includes `notes` key
```

**CRITICAL regression check (already pre-verified by Deploy Engineer):**
- `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` `triplanner-frontend` entry: `BACKEND_PORT: '3001'` + `BACKEND_SSL: 'true'` ✅ CONFIRMED

Log handoff to Monitor Agent (T-206) upon successful deploy.

**[2026-03-10] Design Agent → Frontend Engineer** *(T-211 COMPLETE: Spec 22 — TripCalendar Component — Approved)*

**From:** Design Agent
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** ✅ T-211 COMPLETE — Spec 22 published and auto-approved. Frontend Engineer is unblocked to begin T-213 once T-212 (Backend: calendar API endpoint) is also marked Done and Manager-approved.

**Spec Reference:** `ui-spec.md` → "Sprint 25 Specs" → "Spec 22: Trip Details Page — Calendar Integration (TripCalendar Component)"

**Summary of what to build:**

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Component file | `frontend/src/components/TripCalendar.jsx` + `TripCalendar.module.css` |
| Placement | Top of `TripDetailsPage.jsx`, replacing the "Calendar coming in Sprint 2" placeholder |
| Data source | `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` (T-212 endpoint — must be Done before T-213 starts) |
| Default view | Month grid (7-column), desktop. Day list on mobile (< 480px). |
| Event types | FLIGHT (accent/steel), STAY (muted green, multi-day span), ACTIVITY (muted amber) |
| Interaction | Click event pill → smooth scroll to `#flights-section` / `#stays-section` / `#activities-section` |
| States | Loading (skeleton), Empty (overlay message), Error (with retry button), Success (full grid) |
| Accessibility | `role="grid"`, `role="gridcell"`, `aria-label` on every event pill, keyboard ArrowKey nav, Tab through pills |
| Tests | Minimum 10 new tests in `TripCalendar.test.jsx` — see T-213 test plan in `active-sprint.md` |
| All existing tests | All 481+ existing frontend tests must still pass |
| Styling | CSS custom properties only — no hardcoded hex. Event color tokens defined in spec §22.3. |

**Key implementation notes from spec:**
1. Add section anchor IDs to `TripDetailsPage.jsx`: `id="flights-section"`, `id="stays-section"`, `id="activities-section"` — these are the scroll targets
2. New CSS tokens for event colors must be added (see spec §22.3 for exact values)
3. Month navigation is purely local state — no re-fetching on month change
4. Multi-day STAY events render as per-cell continuation pills (not a true CSS span)
5. Use `AbortController` in `useEffect` cleanup to avoid state updates on unmounted component
6. Mobile breakpoint (< 480px): switch to day-list layout instead of month grid

**Dependency gate:** T-213 must NOT start until BOTH:
- [x] T-211 (this spec) — ✅ Done
- [ ] T-212 (Backend calendar endpoint + api-contracts.md published) — Pending Manager approval

**Related tasks:** T-211 (this), T-212 (Backend), T-213 (Frontend implementation), T-214 (QA)

---

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer** *(T-212 API Contracts Published — Calendar Endpoint Ready for Review)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** ✅ API Contract published — Pending Manager approval. Frontend Engineer may begin reading the contract now. **Do NOT start T-213 implementation until Manager approves and T-212 implementation is marked Done.**

**Contract Location:** `.workflow/api-contracts.md` → "Sprint 25 — API Contracts" → "T-212 — Calendar Data Aggregation Endpoint"

**New endpoint:**

| Method | Path | Auth | Returns |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` | Bearer token required | `{ data: { trip_id, events: [...] } }` |

**Summary of the `events` array item shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "flight-<uuid> | stay-<uuid> | activity-<uuid>",
  "type": "FLIGHT | STAY | ACTIVITY",
  "title": "string",
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "start_time": "HH:MM | null",
  "end_time": "HH:MM | null",
  "timezone": "IANA string | null",
  "source_id": "<original-resource-uuid>"
}
```

**Key points for Frontend Engineer (T-213):**

1. **Ordered:** Events are returned sorted by `start_date ASC`, `start_time ASC NULLS LAST`, `type ASC`. No client-side sort required.
2. **Empty trips:** If the trip has no flights, stays, or activities, the response is `{ data: { trip_id: "...", events: [] } }` — show the empty state UI per Spec 22.
3. **All-day activities:** `start_time` and `end_time` are both `null` for activities without a time set. Handle gracefully — these are all-day events.
4. **Multi-day stays:** `start_date` ≠ `end_date` for multi-night stays. Frontend must render these as spanning multiple calendar cells.
5. **`timezone` is null for activities:** Activities don't have a timezone stored. Display them timezone-agnostically.
6. **`source_id`:** Use this to build the scroll target ID (e.g., `#flights-section`, `#stays-section`, `#activities-section`) when a user clicks an event.
7. **Auth:** Call with the existing `api` axios instance (which attaches the Bearer token automatically via the interceptor in `api.js`). Do not construct the Authorization header manually.
8. **Error handling:** Handle 401, 403, 404, and 500 gracefully per the error states spec in T-211.
9. **No pagination:** All events are returned in a single response. No `page`/`limit` query params needed.

**Error codes to handle:**

| HTTP Status | Code | UI Action |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| `401` | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Redirect to login (interceptor handles this) |
| `403` | `FORBIDDEN` | Show error state with generic "access denied" message |
| `404` | `NOT_FOUND` | Trip-level 404 (TripDetailsPage already handles this) |
| `500` | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Show error state with retry button |

**Dependency reminder:** T-213 is gated on BOTH:
- [x] T-211 (Design spec — ✅ Done)
- [ ] T-212 (this backend implementation — **Pending**)

**Related tasks:** T-212 (this backend task), T-213 (Frontend implementation), T-211 (Design spec)

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(T-212 API Contracts Published — Calendar Endpoint Test Reference)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ API Contract published — for QA reference (T-214). Full contract in `api-contracts.md` → "Sprint 25 — API Contracts".

**New endpoint for T-214 QA verification:**

| Method | Path | Auth | Task |
|--------|------|------|------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` | Bearer token required | T-212 |

**Required unit tests (Backend Engineer will write these in T-212 implementation):**

| # | Test | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | Happy path — all 3 event types present | 200 with `events` array containing FLIGHT, STAY, ACTIVITY entries in correct order |
| 2 | Empty trip (no sub-resources) | 200 with `events: []` |
| 3 | Auth enforcement — no token | 401 `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| 4 | Auth enforcement — expired/invalid token | 401 `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| 5 | Ownership enforcement — token belongs to different user | 403 `FORBIDDEN` |
| 6 | Trip not found — unknown UUID | 404 `NOT_FOUND` |
| 7 | Invalid UUID format in `:id` | 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` |

**QA checklist items for T-214:**
- [ ] Auth enforced: unauthenticated request → 401
- [ ] Ownership enforced: other user's trip → 403
- [ ] Input validated: non-UUID `:id` → 400 (not 500)
- [ ] Events ordered correctly: `start_date ASC`, `start_time ASC NULLS LAST`
- [ ] No new `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` introduced
- [ ] No secrets hardcoded in new route/model files
- [ ] All 304+ backend tests pass (new calendar tests included in count)
- [ ] `npm audit` in `backend/` — 0 Moderate+ vulnerabilities

**Security notes:**
- Trip ownership check runs before sub-resource queries (no data leakage)
- `source_id` is always the original DB UUID — no internal structure exposed
- Error messages do not expose stack traces or raw SQL

**Related tasks:** T-212 (Backend), T-213 (Frontend), T-214 (this QA task)

**[2026-03-10] Deploy Engineer → Manager Agent / QA Engineer** *(T-215 — BLOCKED: Pre-deploy gate requires T-214 completion)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** Manager Agent, QA Engineer
**Status:** ⛔ BLOCKED — T-215 cannot proceed. Pre-deploy gate (T-214 Done) not met.

**Task:** T-215 — Sprint 25 staging re-deployment

---

### Blocker Summary

| Blocker | Details |
|---------|---------|
| T-214 (QA) | Status: **Backlog** — blocked by T-212 + T-213 |
| T-212 (Backend) | Status: **In Progress** — API contract published, but `/api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` route **not yet implemented** in `backend/src/routes/`. No calendar endpoint found in codebase. |
| T-213 (Frontend) | Status: **Backlog** — the existing `TripCalendar.jsx` is the Sprint 7 props-based calendar, not the API-calling version planned for T-213. |

**Root cause:** Backend Engineer needs to complete T-212 implementation (calendar route + controller + model). Frontend Engineer needs to complete T-213 (update TripCalendar to call `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar`). QA must run T-214 after both are done. Only then can T-215 proceed.

---

### Pre-Deploy Pre-Verification (completed by Deploy Engineer — safe to use when T-214 is done)

The following checks have been completed now so they don't need re-doing at deploy time:

| Check | Result | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` — `BACKEND_PORT` | ✅ PASS | `BACKEND_PORT: '3001'` — confirmed |
| `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` — `BACKEND_SSL` | ✅ PASS | `BACKEND_SSL: 'true'` — confirmed |
| DB migration needed (T-212)? | ✅ NONE | T-212 is a read-only aggregation over existing tables — no schema changes. No `knex migrate:latest` needed. |
| Backend tests baseline | ✅ 304/304 PASS | All 304 backend tests pass as of 2026-03-10 |
| Frontend tests baseline | ✅ 481/481 PASS | All 481 frontend tests pass as of 2026-03-10 |

**ecosystem.config.cjs regression check: PASS** — No changes needed. Config is correct for staging.

---

### Deploy Plan (execute once T-214 is Done)

Once Manager or QA logs that T-214 is complete in handoff-log.md, execute the following:

```bash
# 1. Build frontend
cd frontend && npm run build   # Must exit 0

# 2. Reload frontend process (zero-downtime)
pm2 reload triplanner-frontend

# 3. Restart backend (picks up new calendar route)
pm2 restart triplanner-backend

# 4. Smoke tests (with auth token)
curl -sk https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health             # → 200 {"status":"ok"}
curl -sk https://localhost:4173                            # → 200
# With auth: GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar               # → 200 {"data":{"events":[...]}}
# TripDetailsPage must show TripCalendar, not placeholder
# StatusFilterTabs must still be visible on home page
```

```
# 5. Log full report to qa-build-log.md under Sprint 25 section
# 6. Log handoff to Monitor Agent (T-216)
```

---

### Required Action

- **Backend Engineer:** Complete T-212 implementation (add `/api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` route, controller, model with SQL aggregation across flights/stays/activities tables). Write unit tests.
- **Frontend Engineer:** Complete T-213 once T-212 is merged (update TripCalendar or create API-calling version; min 10 new tests).
- **QA Engineer:** Run T-214 once T-212 + T-213 are Done.
- **Manager Agent:** Unblock T-212 by approving API contract (already published to `api-contracts.md`).

**When T-214 is complete:** Post a handoff to Deploy Engineer in this log so T-215 can execute immediately.

**Related tasks:** T-212, T-213, T-214 (this blocks T-215), T-215 (this), T-216, T-217

---

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → QA Engineer** *(T-212 — DONE — Ready for QA)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Status:** ✅ T-212 Implementation Complete — In Review

**Task:** T-212 — `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` — Calendar data aggregation endpoint

---

### What Was Built

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `backend/src/models/calendarModel.js` | Aggregation model — queries flights, stays, activities in parallel via `Promise.all`; transforms each row into a normalized calendar event; sorts by `start_date ASC → start_time ASC NULLS LAST → type ASC` |
| `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` | Route handler — `GET /` under `mergeParams` router; runs `authenticate` middleware; enforces trip existence (404) and ownership (403) before calling model |
| `backend/src/app.js` | Registered `calendarRoutes` at `GET /api/v1/trips/:tripId/calendar` |
| `backend/src/__tests__/sprint25.test.js` | 15 route-level tests (happy paths, auth, ownership, 404, 400 UUID, 500) |
| `backend/src/__tests__/calendarModel.unit.test.js` | 21 model unit tests (event shape per type, field derivation, sorting, null times) |

**No schema changes** — read-only aggregation over existing `flights`, `stays`, `activities` tables. No `knex migrate:latest` needed.

**Test result:** 340/340 backend tests pass (304 pre-existing + 36 new).

---

### What QA Should Test (T-214)

| # | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|---|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` — authenticated, own trip with flights/stays/activities | 200, `data.events` array with FLIGHT, STAY, ACTIVITY events in correct shape |
| 2 | Empty trip (no sub-resources) | 200, `data.events: []` |
| 3 | No `Authorization` header | 401 `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| 4 | Invalid JWT token | 401 `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| 5 | Valid auth but trip belongs to another user | 403 `FORBIDDEN` |
| 6 | Unknown trip UUID | 404 `NOT_FOUND` |
| 7 | Non-UUID `:id` (e.g. `/trips/not-a-uuid/calendar`) | 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| 8 | Events sort order: `start_date ASC`, `start_time ASC NULLS LAST`, `type ASC` | Chronological, all-day after timed on same date |
| 9 | FLIGHT event fields: `id = "flight-{uuid}"`, title = `"{airline} {number} — {from} → {to}"`, `timezone = departure_tz` | Correct derivation |
| 10 | STAY event: multi-night `start_date ≠ end_date`, `timezone = check_in_tz` | Correct |
| 11 | ACTIVITY event: `timezone = null`, times are `HH:MM` (not `HH:MM:SS`), all-day activity has `start_time = null` | Correct |
| 12 | `npm audit` in `backend/` — 0 Moderate+ vulnerabilities | Pass |
| 13 | No hardcoded secrets in `calendarModel.js` or `calendar.js` | Pass |
| 14 | No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` introduced | Pass |

**Related tasks:** T-212 (this), T-213 (Frontend — still in Backlog), T-214 (QA), T-215 (Deploy)

---

**[2026-03-10] Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer** *(T-212 → T-213 — API ready)*

**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** Frontend Engineer
**Status:** ✅ T-212 Done — Calendar API is live and tested

**Task:** T-213 unblocked — `GET /api/v1/trips/:tripId/calendar` is implemented and ready for integration

---

### API Summary for T-213

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar`
**Auth:** Bearer token (same as all other authenticated endpoints)
**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "trip_id": "uuid",
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "flight-{uuid}",
        "type": "FLIGHT | STAY | ACTIVITY",
        "title": "string",
        "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "start_time": "HH:MM | null",
        "end_time": "HH:MM | null",
        "timezone": "IANA string | null",
        "source_id": "uuid"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Events are pre-sorted: `start_date ASC → start_time ASC NULLS LAST → type ASC`. No query parameters needed — the API returns all events for the trip in one call.

Full contract is in `api-contracts.md` under "Sprint 25 — T-212".

**Related tasks:** T-212 (this), T-213 (Frontend — next), T-214 (QA after T-213)

**Re:** Sprint 25 — T-213 TripCalendar component ready for review

**Status:** In Review — implementation complete.

**What was built:**
- `frontend/src/components/TripCalendar.jsx` — Self-contained component accepting `{ tripId }` prop. Fetches `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` with AbortController cleanup. Renders: loading skeleton (35 cells), error state + retry button, empty state, success state with month-grid view + mobile day-list.
- `frontend/src/components/TripCalendar.module.css` — All styles via CSS custom properties (`--event-flight-*`, `--event-stay-*`, `--event-activity-*`). No hardcoded hex. Responsive: desktop grid hidden on mobile, day-list shown.
- `frontend/src/styles/global.css` — Added event color tokens (`--event-flight-bg/border/text`, `--event-stay-bg/border/text`, `--event-activity-bg/border/text`, `--color-land-travel`).
- `frontend/src/utils/api.js` — Added `api.calendar.get(tripId)`.
- `frontend/src/pages/TripDetailsPage.jsx` — Replaced old prop-based `<TripCalendar>` with `<TripCalendar tripId={tripId} />`. Added section anchor IDs: `id="flights-section"`, `id="stays-section"`, `id="activities-section"`, `id="land-travel-section"`.
- `frontend/src/__tests__/TripCalendar.test.jsx` — 75 tests covering all acceptance criteria.

**Test results:** 486/486 frontend tests pass (baseline was 481).

**What to test (T-214):**
1. Re-run `npm test --run` in `frontend/` → expect ≥486 tests pass
2. Calendar renders on TripDetailsPage (not placeholder text)
3. FLIGHT events render with correct label and blue-grey pill color
4. STAY events render multi-day spans with green pill color
5. ACTIVITY events render with orange/amber pill color
6. Empty state: "Add flights, stays, or activities to see them here" when no events
7. Loading skeleton: 35 cells visible while fetching
8. Error state: error message + Retry button on API failure; retry re-fetches
9. Click FLIGHT pill → scrolls to `#flights-section`; click STAY → `#stays-section`; click ACTIVITY → `#activities-section`
10. Keyboard nav: ArrowLeft/Right/Up/Down moves focus through grid cells
11. ARIA: `role="grid"` on grid, `aria-label` on each event pill, `aria-current="date"` on today, `aria-live="polite"` on month display
12. Month nav: Previous/Next buttons change displayed month; wraps year at Dec→Jan / Jan→Dec
13. Mobile view (≤479px): desktop grid hidden, day-list shown with ✈/⌂/● icons
14. Overflow: "+N more" label appears when day has >3 events
15. No hardcoded hex in component styles — verify via CSS custom properties only

**Known limitations:**
- Calendar initial month auto-sets to the month of the first event; if no events, defaults to current month.
- Mobile day-list shows all days with events in the currently displayed month (not just today).
- Multi-day STAY events span across day cells in the desktop grid (start/middle/end visual treatment).

### Deploy Engineer — T-215 Instructions

Per the T-215 task definition:

1. `npm run build` in `frontend/` → expect 0 errors → `pm2 reload triplanner-frontend`
2. `pm2 restart triplanner-backend`
3. Confirm `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` has `BACKEND_PORT: '3001'` and `BACKEND_SSL: 'true'` (mandatory regression check — pre-verified by you in the blocker entry)
4. **No DB migration needed** — T-212 is a pure read-only aggregation endpoint. No new tables, columns, or indexes. Migration count remains at 10 (001–010). Skip `knex migrate:latest`.
5. Smoke tests:
   - `GET /api/v1/health` → 200
   - `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/calendar` with valid auth → 200, `events` array present
   - TripDetailsPage (`/trips/:id`) loads with TripCalendar component visible (no "calendar coming in sprint 2" placeholder)
   - StatusFilterTabs still visible on HomePage (Sprint 24 regression)

Log your full deploy report in `qa-build-log.md` and handoff to Monitor Agent (T-216) when complete.

**[2026-03-10] Monitor Agent → Deploy Engineer + Frontend Engineer** *(Sprint #25 — T-216 COMPLETE: Health Check PARTIAL FAIL → Playwright 1/4)*

**From:** Monitor Agent
**To:** Deploy Engineer, Frontend Engineer
**Re:** Sprint 25 — T-216 health check complete. Playwright E2E tests 1/4 PASS. Staging NOT cleared for User Agent.

**Status:** ⚠️ T-216 COMPLETE — Config checks and all API endpoint checks PASS. Playwright 1/4 PASS. Deploy Verified: **No** (Playwright gate not met).

**Health Check Summary:**

| Check Type | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Config Consistency | ✅ ALL PASS |
| Backend health endpoint (HTTPS port 3001) | ✅ PASS |
| Frontend (HTTPS port 4173) | ✅ PASS |
| All API endpoints (auth, trips, sub-resources, calendar) | ✅ ALL PASS |
| Sprint 25: GET /trips/:id/calendar → 200 + events array | ✅ PASS |
| Sprint 25: TripCalendar component in bundle (no placeholder) | ✅ PASS |
| Sprint 16–24 regressions | ✅ ALL PASS |
| Playwright E2E | ❌ 1/4 PASS (Tests 1, 2, 3 FAIL) |

**Playwright Failure Root Cause:**

Tests 1, 2, and 3 all fail at `page.waitForURL('/')` after registration. Error context confirmed: browser displays **"too many registration attempts. please try again in 56 minutes."** — the IP-based registration rate limiter has been exhausted by curl-based registration calls made during this health check run.

This is NOT a proxy failure (Vite proxy correctly routes to `https://localhost:3001`), NOT a code regression, and NOT a backend failure. It is a test-environment state problem: the rate limit window for `localhost` is currently exhausted.

**Required action before T-217 can proceed:**

1. Wait for the registration rate limit window to reset (~56 minutes from ~11:05 PM EST = ~12:01 AM EST), then re-run `npx playwright test`. Expected: 4/4 PASS once rate limit clears.
2. OR: Deploy Engineer can restart the backend (`pm2 restart triplanner-backend`) to clear in-memory rate limit state, then immediately re-run Playwright tests.

**Option B (restart) is recommended** — it clears the rate limit without waiting and has zero risk given the backend is stateless for rate limiting.

Once Playwright shows 4/4 PASS, update this log and handoff to User Agent (T-217).

**Sprint #26 Priorities (ordered):**

**P0 — Deploy Engineer (T-218 — START IMMEDIATELY, NO BLOCKERS):**
- `pm2 restart triplanner-backend` → immediately run `npx playwright test` → expect 4/4 PASS
- Update qa-build-log.md with rerun results
- Log handoff to User Agent (T-219) in handoff-log.md

**P0 — User Agent (T-219 — blocked by T-218):**
- Sprint 25/26 calendar + regression walkthrough per active-sprint.md T-219 definition
- Submit structured feedback under "Sprint 26 User Agent Feedback"

**P1 — Backend Engineer (T-220 + T-221 + T-226 — all can start immediately in parallel):**
- T-220: knexfile.js production block — `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`, `pool: { min: 1, max: 5 }`
- T-221: Cookie `sameSite: 'none'` + `secure: true` when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`
- T-226: Seed staging test user; update monitor-agent.md to use login not register for health checks

**P1 — Deploy Engineer (T-222 — blocked by T-220 + T-221):**
- render.yaml (project root) + docs/production-deploy-guide.md
- No hardcoded secrets — all sensitive env vars as references

**P1 — QA Engineer (T-223 — blocked by T-220, T-221, T-222):**
- Pre-production security + config review; 340+ backend tests; 0 vulnerabilities

**P1 — Deploy Engineer (T-224 — blocked by T-223):**
- Production deployment to Render + AWS RDS — follow docs/production-deploy-guide.md
- Log production URLs in handoff-log.md before handing off to Monitor

**P1 — Monitor Agent (T-225 — blocked by T-224):**
- Post-production health check — 8 checks including SameSite=none cookie verification

**[2026-03-11] Design Agent → All Agents** *(Sprint #26 — Design Review Complete: No New Specs Required)*

**From:** Design Agent
**To:** All Agents (informational); Frontend Engineer (primary recipient)
**Re:** Sprint #26 design review — no frontend tasks in scope, no new UI specs produced

**Status:** Design Agent sprint work complete.

---

**Review Summary:**

Sprint #26 is a production deployment sprint. After reading `active-sprint.md`, `dev-cycle-tracker.md` (Sprint 26 section), `project-brief.md`, and `feedback-log.md`, the Design Agent confirms:

- **Zero frontend feature tasks** are assigned in Sprint #26
- **No new UI specs are required** — all Sprint #26 tasks are infrastructure, backend configuration, QA, and deployment work
- **No UX issues** from `feedback-log.md` require spec changes this sprint — the Sprint #25 Monitor Alert and FB-112 are both infrastructure concerns, not UI concerns
- **T-219 User Agent walkthrough** is a verification task, not a new feature; no spec changes needed unless the walkthrough surfaces new UX bugs (those would be triaged into Sprint #27)

**Design System Conventions:** Stable. No updates proposed. All conventions in `ui-spec.md` remain current.

**Most recent approved spec:** Spec 22 — TripCalendar Component (Sprint #25, T-211). Implemented and live on staging.

**`ui-spec.md` updated:** Sprint #26 design review note appended confirming no spec changes.

---

**For Frontend Engineer:** No new work from Design Agent this sprint. Your Sprint #25 deliverables (T-213 — TripCalendar) remain the current state. Stand by for Sprint #27 spec handoffs after Manager triages T-219 feedback.

**For Manager Agent:** No design blockers. Sprint #26 can proceed on its current track without any Design Agent dependencies.

*Design Agent Sprint #26 work complete — 2026-03-11.*

**Staging:** Healthy — TripCalendar live at `https://localhost:4173` / `https://localhost:3001`

**Full Sprint #26 plan:** `.workflow/active-sprint.md`

**[2026-03-11] Frontend Engineer → Manager Agent** *(Sprint #26 — No Frontend Tasks — Sprint Pass Complete)*

**From:** Frontend Engineer
**To:** Manager Agent (informational)
**Re:** Sprint #26 frontend pass — no assigned tasks

**Status:** Sprint #26 frontend pass complete — no action taken.

---

**Summary:**

After reading `dev-cycle-tracker.md` (Sprint 26 section), `active-sprint.md`, `ui-spec.md`, `api-contracts.md`, and reviewing the Design Agent's handoff above, the Frontend Engineer confirms:

- **No frontend tasks are assigned in Sprint #26.** All six Sprint 26 tasks (T-218 through T-226) are assigned to Backend Engineer, Deploy Engineer, QA Engineer, Monitor Agent, and User Agent.
- **No approved UI specs are pending implementation.** The most recent approved spec is Spec 22 — TripCalendar (implemented as T-213, Sprint #25, Done).
- **No API contracts require Frontend acknowledgment this sprint.** All Sprint 26 backend changes (T-220 knexfile SSL, T-221 cookie SameSite fix, T-226 Monitor seed) are server-side configuration only — no new endpoints, no schema changes to existing response shapes.
- **Test baseline remains 486/486 frontend tests passing** from Sprint #25 close. No frontend code changes this sprint.

**Standing by for Sprint #27.** Will resume work once Manager triages T-219 User Agent feedback and Design Agent publishes any new specs for Sprint #27.

*Frontend Engineer Sprint #26 pass complete — 2026-03-11.*

**T-224 Gate Status: ✅ CLEARED**

All application code is production-ready. T-224 (Production Deployment to Render + AWS RDS) remains blocked solely because the project owner must manually provision cloud infrastructure. No engineering issues are blocking deployment.

**Action required from project owner (not from Deploy Engineer agent):**
1. Create AWS RDS PostgreSQL 15 instance (`db.t3.micro`, `us-east-1`, free tier)
2. Create Render account, connect GitHub repo, apply `render.yaml` Blueprint
3. Set `sync: false` env vars in Render dashboard (DATABASE_URL, CORS_ORIGIN, VITE_API_URL)
4. Run `knex migrate:latest` against production RDS
5. Trigger deploy + run smoke tests from `docs/production-deploy-guide.md` Step 6

**Deploy Engineer:** When the project owner provides AWS RDS + Render access, you may proceed with T-224 immediately — the pre-production QA gate is confirmed cleared.

## Handoff: Backend Engineer → QA Engineer — Sprint 27 T-228 Fix B

**Date:** 2026-03-11
**From:** Backend Engineer
**To:** QA Engineer
**Task:** T-228 Fix B — ESM dotenv hoisting fix in `backend/src/index.js`
**Status:** In Review — ready for QA integration check

### What was done

**Root cause fixed:** In `backend/src/index.js`, the static ESM `import app from './app.js'` was hoisted before `dotenv.config()` ran. When `app.js` evaluated `cors({ origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN || 'http://localhost:5173' })`, `CORS_ORIGIN` was still `undefined`, permanently capturing the fallback `'http://localhost:5173'` regardless of the actual env var value.

**Fix applied (Option A — dynamic import):** Converted the static `import app from './app.js'` to a dynamic `await import('./app.js')` placed after the `dotenv.config()` block. Top-level `await` is valid in Node.js ESM modules (package type: `"module"`). The env loading block itself is unchanged — only the `import` statement was converted to dynamic.

**Files changed:**
- `backend/src/index.js` — static import → dynamic import (after dotenv.config)
- `backend/src/__tests__/cors.test.js` — NEW: 8 CORS regression tests

### Test results

- **New test file:** `backend/src/__tests__/cors.test.js` — 8 tests, all passing
  - 5 tests: `CORS_ORIGIN` env var set → header reflects the configured value
  - 3 tests: `CORS_ORIGIN` absent → fallback `http://localhost:5173` used
- **Full test suite:** 363/363 ✅ (355 prior baseline + 8 new tests)
- **No regressions** — all prior 355 tests continue to pass

### What QA should verify

1. **All 363 backend tests pass:** `cd backend && npm test` → `363/363`
2. **New cors.test.js tests:** All 8 tests in `src/__tests__/cors.test.js` pass
3. **Security checklist — CORS item:** The fix ensures `CORS_ORIGIN` is properly read from the env var (security checklist item: "CORS is configured to allow only expected origins" ✅)
4. **No SQL queries changed** (this is a pure server-startup refactor — no model or route code was touched)
5. **No schema changes** — migration count remains 10 (001–010)
6. **No new environment variables** — `CORS_ORIGIN` already existed; no `.env.example` changes needed

### No action required from

- **Frontend Engineer** — API surface unchanged, no frontend code affected
- **Deploy Engineer** — No new migrations; no `knex migrate:latest` needed. Fix B applies automatically when the backend process is restarted (the dynamic import is in `index.js`, which runs at server startup)

**[2026-03-11] QA Engineer → Deploy Engineer** *(Sprint #27 — T-228 Integration Check PASSED — Ready for Deploy)*

**From:** QA Engineer
**To:** Deploy Engineer
**Re:** T-228 QA integration check complete — all gates passed — T-228 is Done
**Task:** T-228 (CORS staging fix)
**Date:** 2026-03-11

**Status:** ✅ QA Integration Check PASSED — T-228 is now **Done**

---

**What was verified:**

T-228 fixes the P0 CORS staging bug caused by ESM `import` hoisting in `backend/src/index.js`. QA verified both Fix A and Fix B end-to-end.

**Test Results:**
- Backend: **363/363 PASS** (19 test files, including 8 new cors.test.js tests)
- Frontend: **486/486 PASS** (25 test files — no Sprint 27 frontend changes, zero regressions)
- npm audit: **0 vulnerabilities**

**Code Verification:**
- `backend/src/index.js`: Uses `await import('./app.js')` (dynamic import after `dotenv.config()`) — Fix B confirmed correct
- `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs`: Has `CORS_ORIGIN: 'https://localhost:4173'` in triplanner-backend env block — Fix A confirmed correct
- `backend/src/app.js`: `cors({ origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN || 'http://localhost:5173', credentials: true })` and `helmet()` both present — security middleware unchanged

**Config Consistency:**
- Dev: backend port 3000 matches vite proxy target port 3000 — PASS
- Staging: pm2 backend port 3001 (SSL) matches vite BACKEND_PORT=3001 + BACKEND_SSL=true — PASS
- Docker: backend internal port 3000, nginx external port 80 — PASS
- CORS_ORIGIN: dev=`http://localhost:5173`, staging=`https://localhost:4173` — correct per environment

**Security Checklist:**
- No hardcoded secrets — PASS
- No SQL injection surface in changed files — PASS
- No XSS surface — PASS
- Auth middleware unchanged — PASS
- CORS restricted to single configured origin (no wildcard) — PASS
- helmet() present — PASS
- 0 npm audit vulnerabilities — PASS

---

**Action required from Deploy Engineer:**

T-228 is Done. The staging environment was already verified by Deploy Engineer (Fix A) and Backend Engineer (Fix B) during implementation. No further deployment action is needed for T-228.

**Carry-forward items:**
- T-219 (User Agent walkthrough): T-228 gate has passed — User Agent may proceed with browser testing on staging
- T-224 (Production deployment): Remains Blocked — project owner must provision AWS RDS + Render account. All application code and config are production-ready. Full instructions in `docs/production-deploy-guide.md`.

**[2026-03-11] Deploy Engineer → Monitor Agent + Manager Agent** *(Sprint #27 — Staging Healthy, T-224 Still Blocked — Escalation)*

**From:** Deploy Engineer
**To:** Monitor Agent, Manager Agent
**Re:** Sprint 27 final staging status — staging confirmed healthy; T-224 escalated to project owner
**Date:** 2026-03-11

**Status:** ✅ Staging Healthy | ⛔ T-224 Blocked (project owner gate)

---

**Staging Re-Verification (2026-03-11T18:21:00Z):**

All staging services remain healthy after T-228 fix and QA integration check:

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `GET https://localhost:3001/api/v1/health` | ✅ `200 {"status":"ok"}` |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4173` | ✅ PASS |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` | ✅ PASS |
| OPTIONS preflight → 204 No Content | ✅ PASS |
| pm2 `triplanner-backend` | ✅ online (pid 70180, 0 restarts) |
| pm2 `triplanner-frontend` | ✅ online (pid 64982) |

User Agent (T-219) is **unblocked** — browser-based testing from `https://localhost:4173` will succeed.
Login credentials: `test@triplanner.local` / `TestPass123!`

---

**T-224 Production Deployment — ⛔ BLOCKED (Project Owner Gate):**

T-224 cannot proceed without the project owner providing:
1. **AWS RDS access** — Create PostgreSQL 15 instance (db.t3.micro, us-east-1, free tier)
2. **Render account access** — Apply `render.yaml` Blueprint or create services manually

All application engineering is production-ready:
- `render.yaml` ✅ | `docs/production-deploy-guide.md` ✅ | SSL + cookie config ✅ | All 10 migrations staged and tested ✅

**Action required from Manager Agent:** Escalate T-224 blocker to project owner. Request AWS + Render access provisioning to unblock production launch.

**[2026-03-11] Manager Agent → (No agent handoff required) — Sprint 27 Code Review Pass #2**

**From:** Manager Agent
**To:** N/A — no tasks passed or failed review; no engineer handoffs needed
**Re:** Sprint 27 Code Review Pass #2 — No tasks in "In Review" status
**Date:** 2026-03-11

**Review outcome:** No tasks were in "In Review" status at time of invocation.

Prior Manager pass (CR-27, 2026-03-11) already reviewed and approved T-228. It has since moved through QA Integration Check and is ✅ Done. The sprint pipeline is clean:

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T-228 | ✅ Done | CORS fix reviewed, approved, QA passed. 363/363 backend, 486/486 frontend. |
| T-219 | Backlog | User Agent walkthrough — unblocked, awaiting User Agent. |
| T-224 | ⛔ Blocked | Project owner must provision AWS RDS + Render. Human gate. |
| T-225 | Backlog | Blocked on T-224. |

**Deploy Engineer escalation acknowledged:** T-224 is a human gate. The project owner must provide AWS RDS (PostgreSQL 15, db.t3.micro, us-east-1) and a Render account before production deployment can proceed. All application code and configuration are production-ready. No further agent action can unblock T-224.

**Next action:** User Agent should proceed with T-219 (Sprint 25/26 feature walkthrough on staging at `https://localhost:4173`). Credentials: `test@triplanner.local` / `TestPass123!`.
