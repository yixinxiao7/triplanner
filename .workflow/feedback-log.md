## Monitor Alert — Sprint #22 — 2026-03-10T21:25:00Z

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Category** | Monitor Alert |
| **Severity** | Critical |
| **Sprint** | 22 |
| **Status** | Resolved |
| **Related Task** | T-200 |

**Feedback:** Staging Vite proxy ECONNREFUSED — browser-based API calls fail; 3/4 Playwright E2E tests fail.

**Details:**

The `triplanner-frontend` pm2 process runs `npm run preview` without the environment variables required for staging (`BACKEND_PORT=3001`, `BACKEND_SSL=true`). Vite's dev proxy defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. The staging backend runs on `https://localhost:3001`. Every browser-initiated API call (register, login, trips, etc.) results in:

```
[vite] http proxy error: /api/v1/auth/register — AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
[vite] http proxy error: /api/v1/auth/refresh — AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
```

**Impact:**
- All 3 user-flow Playwright tests fail (Tests 1, 2, 3 — register → redirect to "/" timeout)
- User Agent (T-201) CANNOT proceed — staging is not usable for browser testing
- Direct API calls (curl) work correctly; only browser flows are broken

**Required Fix:**
1. Update `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` to include the `triplanner-frontend` app with:
   ```
   env: { BACKEND_PORT: '3001', BACKEND_SSL: 'true' }
   ```
   OR add `preview.proxy` to `frontend/vite.config.js` for the staging environment.
2. Restart pm2 frontend process with the corrected env.
3. Rerun `npx playwright test` — expect 4/4 PASS.

**Files involved:**
- `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs` — missing frontend app definition (primary fix)
- `frontend/vite.config.js` — `preview.proxy` not configured (alternative fix)

### FB-112 — Production hosting decision lost — re-submit from Sprint 17

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feedback | Production hosting decision (Render + AWS RDS) was made in Sprint 17 (FB-109, FB-110, FB-111) but never triaged into sprint tasks; B-022 incorrectly blocked for 8 sprints |
| Sprint | 25 |
| Category | Feature Gap |
| Severity | Critical |
| Status | New |
| Related Task | B-022 |

**Description:** The project owner made a clear production hosting decision during Sprint 17, recorded as FB-109, FB-110, and FB-111 in the feedback log (now archived to `feedback-log-before-sprint-18.md`). The Manager Agent failed to triage these entries into actionable T-xxx tasks during the Sprint 17→18 closeout. Once the feedback log was archived, the decision was lost, and every subsequent sprint has incorrectly listed B-022 as "pending project owner decision."

**The decision (re-stated):**

- **Frontend:** Render free tier — static site, region: Ohio
- **Backend:** Render free tier — web service, runtime: node, region: Ohio
- **Database:** AWS RDS free tier — us-east-1 (N. Virginia), engine: PostgreSQL 15+, instance class: db.t3.micro

**Three critical implementation requirements:**

1. **Knexfile production config (from FB-109):** Add SSL configuration and free-tier connection pool sizing for AWS RDS to `backend/knexfile.js`. AWS RDS requires `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` (or proper CA cert). Free-tier pool size should be conservative (max 5 connections for db.t3.micro).

2. **Cookie SameSite fix (from FB-110):** Set cookie `SameSite` to `none` and `Secure` to `true` in production. On Render free tier, frontend and backend will be on different subdomains (e.g., `triplanner-frontend.onrender.com` and `triplanner-backend.onrender.com`), making this a cross-origin deployment. Without `SameSite=none`, refresh token cookies will not be sent, and auth will be completely broken.

3. **render.yaml blueprint + deploy guide (from FB-111):** Create `render.yaml` infrastructure-as-code file defining both services (frontend static site + backend web service, both Ohio region, free plan). Create a production deploy guide covering: Render service setup, AWS RDS instance creation, environment variable configuration, database migration, DNS/domain setup, and post-deploy verification checklist.

**Action required from Manager Agent:** Create T-xxx tasks from this decision immediately. B-022 is no longer blocked on the project owner — it is blocked on engineering work that should have started 8 sprints ago.
